## Nested Classes In JAVA
Nested classes in Java are classes that are defined within another class. They provide a way to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increase encapsulation, and improve code organization. There are several types of nested classes: static nested classes, non-static (inner) nested classes, local classes, and anonymous classes. Let's explore each type with examples and important points:

### 1. Static Nested Classes:

- **Definition**: Static nested classes are declared using the `static` keyword within the body of another class.
- **Access**: They can access static members of the enclosing class, but they cannot access non-static members directly.
- **Instantiation**: Since they are static, they can be instantiated without an instance of the enclosing class.
- **Use Cases**: Grouping related classes, providing a namespace, and improving encapsulation.

```java
class Outer {
    static class StaticNested {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Static nested class");
        }
    }
}
// Instantiating a static nested class
Outer.StaticNested nested = new Outer.StaticNested();
nested.display();
```

### 2. Non-Static (Inner) Nested Classes:

- **Definition**: Inner classes are declared without the `static` keyword within the body of another class.
- **Access**: They can access both static and non-static members of the enclosing class.
- **Instantiation**: They have access to the instance of the enclosing class, so they can modify its state.
- **Use Cases**: Implementing data structures like linked lists, providing multiple implementations of an interface, and enhancing encapsulation.

```java
class Outer {
    class Inner {
        void display() {
            System.out.println("Inner class");
        }
    }
}
// Instantiating an inner class
Outer outer = new Outer();
Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
inner.display();
```

### 3. Local Classes:

- **Definition**: Local classes are declared within a block of code, typically within a method or a constructor.
- **Access**: They have access to the local variables and parameters of the enclosing method (or constructor), `but these variables must be effectively final`.
- **Use Cases**: Implementing callbacks, event listeners, or small helper classes that are only needed within a specific method.

```java
class Outer {
    void method() {
        class Local {
            void display() {
                System.out.println("Local class");
            }
        }
        Local local = new Local();
        local.display();
    }
}
// Instantiating a local class
Outer outer = new Outer();
outer.method();
```

### 4. Anonymous Classes:

- **Definition**: Anonymous classes are local classes without a name that are declared and instantiated at the same time.
- **Use Cases**: Implementing one-time-use classes, such as event listeners or thread runners.

```java
class Outer {
    void method() {
        Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Anonymous class");
            }
        };
        Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);
        thread.start();
    }
}
// Instantiating an anonymous class
Outer outer = new Outer();
outer.method();
```

### Important Points:

- Nested classes can access members (fields and methods) of the enclosing class, even if they are private.
- Inner classes can have any access modifier (public, protected, package-private, or private), whereas static nested classes cannot have the access modifier `private`.
- Local classes and anonymous classes cannot have access modifiers.
- Anonymous classes cannot have constructors because they do not have a name.
- Non-static nested classes (inner classes) hold an implicit reference to an instance of the enclosing class, so they cannot be declared static.
- Static nested classes do not have access to the instance variables and methods of the enclosing class unless they are static.

Understanding nested classes and their different types is important for designing clean and modular Java code. Each type of nested class has its own strengths and use cases, and choosing the right type depends on the specific requirements of your application.
