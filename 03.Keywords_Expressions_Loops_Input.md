## Keywords And Expressions In Java
here's an overview of some of the key keywords and expressions in Java:

1. **Keywords**:
    - **public**: Access modifier used to specify that a method or class can be accessed by any other code.
    - **private**: Access modifier used to restrict access to methods and fields to within the same class.
    - **protected**: Access modifier used to allow access within the same package and by subclasses.
    - **static**: Keyword used to declare a class member (method or field) that belongs to the class rather than any specific instance of the class.
    - **final**: Keyword used to declare that a variable cannot be changed, a method cannot be overridden, or a class cannot be subclassed.
    - **abstract**: Keyword used to declare a class or method that is incomplete and must be implemented by a subclass.
    - **class**: Keyword used to declare a class.
    - **interface**: Keyword used to declare an interface, which is a contract for methods that implementing classes must define.
    - **extends**: Keyword used to indicate that a class inherits from another class.
    - **implements**: Keyword used to indicate that a class implements one or more interfaces.
    - **super**: Keyword used to refer to the superclass of the current object.
    - **this**: Keyword used to refer to the current object.
    - **void**: Keyword used to indicate that a method does not return a value.
    - **return**: Keyword used to exit a method and optionally return a value.
    - **if, else**: Keywords used for conditional branching.
    - **for, while, do-while**: Keywords used for looping constructs.
    - **try, catch, finally**: Keywords used for exception handling.
    - **throw, throws**: Keywords used to manually throw exceptions and declare exceptions that a method might throw, respectively.

2. **Expressions**:
    - **Arithmetic expressions**: Using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
    - **Boolean expressions**: Using operators like `&&` (logical AND), `||` (logical OR), `!` (logical NOT).
    - **Assignment expressions**: Using `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc., for assigning values to variables.
    - **Comparison expressions**: Using operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
    - **Conditional expressions**: Using the ternary operator `? :` for conditional assignment.
    - **Instanceof expressions**: Checking whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.
    - **Method invocation expressions**: Calling methods on objects.
    - **Lambda expressions**: Introduced in Java 8 for writing concise anonymous functions.
    - **Array access expressions**: Accessing elements of arrays using square brackets `[]`.
    - **Object creation expressions**: Using the `new` keyword to create new instances of classes.
    - **Type casting expressions**: Converting from one data type to another, e.g., `(int)`, `(String)`.
    - **Bitwise expressions**: Using operators like `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>` for bitwise operations.

These are just some of the fundamental keywords and expressions in Java, and there are many more features and nuances to explore within the language.


## WHiteSpace And Indentation In JAVA
In Java, whitespace and indentation play a crucial role in code readability and organization. While Java ignores whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines) outside of string literals and comments, proper indentation enhances code clarity and maintainability. Here's an overview of whitespace and indentation conventions in Java:

1. **Whitespace**:
    - Whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) are used to separate tokens in Java code.
    - They are ignored by the Java compiler outside of string literals and comments.
    - Whitespace within string literals is preserved as part of the string.
    - Excessive or inconsistent whitespace can negatively impact code readability and should be avoided.

2. **Indentation**:
    - Indentation is the practice of aligning code blocks to visually represent their hierarchy and structure.
    - In Java, indentation is typically done using a consistent number of spaces or tabs for each level of indentation.
    - Indentation is used to visually indicate nested code blocks, such as loops, conditionals, and method bodies.
    - Proper indentation makes code easier to read and understand, especially for complex code with multiple levels of nesting.
    - Most Java style guides recommend using spaces for indentation, typically four spaces per level.
    - IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and text editors often provide features to automatically format code and enforce indentation rules.

Example of properly indented Java code:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        if (x > 5) {
            System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
        } else {
            System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
        }
    }
}
```

In the example above:
- The class `Example` and the `main` method are aligned at the same level of indentation.
- The `if` statement body is indented to indicate it is nested within the `main` method.
- The `else` statement body is also indented to align with the corresponding `if` statement.

Consistent and proper indentation practices improve code readability, maintainability, and collaboration among developers working on the same codebase.


## Conditionals In JAVA
In Java, the `if-else` statement is a fundamental control flow construct used to make decisions based on conditions. It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to `true` or `false`. Here's an overview of `if-else` in Java:

1. **Syntax**:
```java
if (condition) {
    // Block of code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // Block of code to execute if the condition is false
}
```

2. **Behavior**:
   - The `condition` is a boolean expression that determines which block of code gets executed.
   - If the `condition` evaluates to `true`, the code block associated with the `if` statement is executed.
   - If the `condition` evaluates to `false`, the code block associated with the `else` statement (if present) is executed.
   - The `else` block is optional. If it's not present and the `condition` is `false`, no code is executed.
   - You can have multiple `else if` blocks to handle additional conditions.
   - The `if-else` statement can be nested within other `if-else` statements to handle more complex logic.

3. **Examples**:
```java
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
}
```
Output:
```
x is greater than 5
```

```java
int x = 3;

if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
}
```
Output:
```
x is not greater than 5
```

4. **Nested `if-else`**:
```java
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
int z = 10;

if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
    if (x < z) {
        System.out.println("x is less than z");
    } else {
        System.out.println("x is equal to z");
    }
}
```

5. **Chained `if-else`**:
```java
int num = 0;

if (num > 0) {
    System.out.println("Positive");
} else if (num < 0) {
    System.out.println("Negative");
} else {
    System.out.println("Zero");
}
```

`if-else` statements are fundamental to branching logic in Java and are used extensively in writing conditional code to handle various scenarios and make decisions based on different conditions.

**NOTE -** always use `condition` or `true` and `false` in conditionals, here `truthy` and `falsy` value dosen't works with if else statements.

## Methods In JAVA
In Java, methods are a fundamental building block of a program, encapsulating a set of actions that can be performed. Here's an overview of methods in Java:

1. **Method Declaration**:
   - A method in Java is declared within a class.
   - It consists of a method signature and a method body.
   - The method signature includes the method's name, return type, and parameters (if any).

Example:
```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

2. **Return Type**:
   - A method may have a return type, which specifies the type of value that the method returns after its execution.
   - If a method doesn't return any value, its return type is `void`.
   - If a method returns a value, the `return` statement is used to return the value.

Example:
```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

3. **Parameters**:
   - Parameters are variables that are declared as part of the method signature.
   - They specify the values that need to be passed to the method when it is called.
   - Methods can have zero or more parameters.

Example:
```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

4. **Method Overloading**:
   - Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
   - Java determines which method to execute based on the number and type of arguments provided during method invocation.

Example:
```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

public double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

5. **Method Invocation**:
   - Methods are invoked using the dot notation (`object.method()`) or the class name (`ClassName.method()` for `static` methods).
   - Parameters, if any, are passed within parentheses.

Example:
```java
int sum = add(5, 3); // Invocation of the add method
```

6. **Access Modifiers**:
   - Access modifiers such as `public`, `private`, and `protected` control the accessibility of methods.
   - `public` methods can be accessed from anywhere, while `private` methods are only accessible within the same class.
   - `protected` methods are accessible within the same package and by subclasses.

Example:
```java
public class MyClass {
    public void myPublicMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    private void myPrivateMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }

    protected void myProtectedMethod() {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

Methods are essential for organizing code into reusable components, promoting modularity, and improving code readability and maintainability in Java programs.

## Switch Statements In JAVA
In Java, a switch statement is a control flow construct used to perform different actions based on the value of a variable or expression. It provides a convenient way to write code that executes different blocks of statements depending on the value of a single variable or expression. Here's an overview of switch statements in Java:

1. **Syntax**:
```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Statements to execute if expression equals value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Statements to execute if expression equals value2
        break;
    // Additional cases...
    default:
        // Statements to execute if none of the cases match
}
```

2. **Behavior**:
   - The `switch` statement evaluates the `expression` and compares it against the values specified in the `case` labels.
   - If the value of the `expression` matches a `case` label, the corresponding block of statements is executed.
   - If no `case` label matches the value of the `expression`, the `default` block (if present) is executed.
   - The `break` statement is used to exit the switch block after executing a case. If `break` is omitted, execution will "fall through" to the next case (unless it's the end of the switch or another `break` is encountered).
   - The `default` case is optional and is executed when none of the `case` labels match the value of the `expression`.
   - Each `case` label must be a compile-time constant (literal value, enum constant, or final variable).

3. **Example**:
```java
int day = 3;
String dayName;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        dayName = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        dayName = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        dayName = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        dayName = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        dayName = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        dayName = "Saturday";
        break;
    case 7:
        dayName = "Sunday";
        break;
    default:
        dayName = "Invalid day";
}

System.out.println("Day is: " + dayName);
```

4. **Use Cases**:
   - Switch statements are commonly used when you have a single variable or expression with multiple possible values and you want to execute different blocks of code based on those values.
   - They are often used to replace long chains of `if-else` statements for improved readability and maintainability.
   - Switch statements are particularly useful when dealing with enums or constants where the set of possible values is known at compile time.

Switch statements offer a concise and readable way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of an expression in Java. However, they should be used judiciously, especially when dealing with complex or floating-point comparisons, as they have limitations compared to if-else statements.

#### Enhanced  Switch Statement
The enhanced switch statement and the `yield` keyword were introduced in Java 13 as part of JEP 354 (Switch Expressions). This enhancement extends the traditional switch statement to support both statement form and expression form. Here's an overview of the enhanced switch statement and the `yield` keyword in Java:

1. **Enhanced Switch Statement**:
   - Traditionally, the switch statement in Java supports the statement form, where each case block contains statements and ends with a `break` statement to exit the switch block.
   - With the introduction of the enhanced switch statement, switch blocks can also be used as expressions, allowing you to assign their result to a variable or return it from a method directly.

2. **Syntax**:
```java
int result = switch (expression) {
    case value1 -> expression1;
    case value2 -> expression2;
    // Additional cases...
    default -> expressionDefault;
};
```

3. **`yield` Keyword**:
   - In the enhanced switch statement, the `yield` keyword is used to return a value from a switch block when it is used as an expression.
   - Each `case` label in the switch block is followed by `->`, indicating the expression that should be evaluated if the `expression` matches the `case` value.
   - After evaluating the expression, the `yield` keyword is used to return the value.

4. **Example**:
```java
int day = 3;
String dayName = switch (day) {
    case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Weekday";
    case 6, 7 -> "Weekend";
    default -> "Invalid day";
};

System.out.println("Day is: " + dayName);
```

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Enhanced switch statements with `yield` are particularly useful for concise and expressive code when dealing with switch blocks that need to return a value.
   - They provide a more compact syntax compared to traditional switch statements, especially when each case block returns a value.
   - The `yield` keyword simplifies the process of returning values from switch expressions, making the code more readable and maintainable.

The enhanced switch statement with the `yield` keyword improves the expressiveness and readability of switch blocks in Java, especially in scenarios where switch blocks are used as expressions. It provides a more concise syntax for returning values from switch expressions, enhancing developer productivity and code clarity.

## Looping In JAVA
In Java, loops are control structures that allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times based on certain conditions. There are several types of loops available in Java:

1. **for loop:**
   The `for` loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration.
   ```java
   for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

2. **while loop:**
   The `while` loop is used when you want to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
   ```java
   while (condition) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

3. **do-while loop:**
   The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after the execution of the loop's body. This means that the code inside the loop will always execute at least once.
   ```java
   do {
       // code to be executed
   } while (condition);
   ```

4. **Enhanced for loop (for-each loop):**
   The enhanced `for` loop is used for iterating over elements of arrays and collections. It simplifies iterating through collections without needing explicit initialization and termination conditions.
   ```java
   for (type element : array/collection) {
       // code to be executed
   }
   ```

Each type of loop has its use cases and advantages. `for` and `while` loops are commonly used when the number of iterations is known or determined by a condition, respectively. The `do-while` loop is suitable when you want to ensure that the loop body is executed at least once. Enhanced `for` loops are convenient when working with collections or arrays, providing a concise syntax for iteration. Choosing the appropriate loop depends on the specific requirements of your program.

## Scope And Variables in C++
In Java, a variable's scope defines where in the code that variable can be accessed or referenced. Variables can have different scopes depending on where they are declared within a Java program. There are primarily three types of variables based on scope: local variables, instance variables, and class (static) variables. Here, I'll focus on local variables and their scope:

1. **Local Variables:**
   Local variables are declared within a method, constructor, or block of code. They are accessible only within the block of code in which they are declared. Once the block of code exits, the local variable is destroyed, and its memory is released.

   ```java
   public class Example {
       public void myMethod() {
           int x = 10; // x is a local variable
           System.out.println(x); // x is accessible here
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above example, the variable `x` is a local variable within the `myMethod()` method. It is only accessible within the method.

2. **Scope of Local Variables:**
   The scope of a local variable is limited to the block of code in which it is declared. This means that you cannot access a local variable from outside its enclosing block, and you cannot declare another variable with the same name in the same block.

   ```java
   public class Example {
       public void myMethod() {
           int x = 10; // x is a local variable
           System.out.println(x); // x is accessible here
       }

       public void anotherMethod() {
           // System.out.println(x); // Error: x cannot be accessed here
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above example, `x` cannot be accessed in the `anotherMethod()` because it is out of scope.

3. **Lifetime of Local Variables:**
   The lifetime of a local variable is limited to the execution time of the block of code in which it is declared. Once the block of code completes execution, the local variable is destroyed, and its memory is reclaimed by the JVM.

   ```java
   public class Example {
       public void myMethod() {
           int x = 10; // x is a local variable
           System.out.println(x); // x is accessible here
       } // End of myMethod(), x is destroyed here
   }
   ```

   In the above example, once `myMethod()` completes its execution, the variable `x` goes out of scope and is destroyed.

Understanding the scope and lifetime of local variables is essential for writing bug-free and maintainable Java code. It helps in preventing unintended access to variables and managing memory efficiently.

## Classes And Objects
In Java, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Let's break down each of these terms along with static and instance (normal) data members, and how they are declared and executed:

1. **Classes:**
   A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that type will have. In Java, classes are declared using the `class` keyword.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       // Fields (data members)
       private int x;
       private String name;
       
       // Methods
       public void setName(String name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
       
       public String getName() {
           return name;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Objects:**
   An object is an instance of a class. It is created using the `new` keyword followed by a call to the class constructor. Each object has its own set of instance variables and methods.

   ```java
   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Creating an object of MyClass
           obj.setName("John"); // Setting the name using a method
           System.out.println(obj.getName()); // Getting the name using a method
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Static Data Members:**
   Static data members belong to the class rather than any specific instance of the class. They are shared among all instances of the class. They are declared using the `static` keyword.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       private static int count = 0; // Static data member

       public MyClass() {
           count++; // Incrementing count each time a new object is created
       }

       public static int getCount() {
           return count; // Accessing static data member
       }
   }
   ```

   And these static data members and methods can be called using class name for example `ClassName.StaticMethod()`
   ```java
   Integer.parseInt("23"); // calling static method
   
   "Hello".toUpperCase(); // calling normal method using a object.

   ```

4. **Normal (Instance) Data Members:**
   Normal data members, also known as instance variables, are associated with each instance of the class. They are not shared among instances and can have different values for each object.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       private int x; // Normal data member

       public void setX(int x) {
           this.x = x; // Setting the value of x for the current object
       }

       public int getX() {
           return x; // Getting the value of x for the current object
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Execution:**
   - Static data members are initialized when the class is loaded into memory and exist until the program terminates.
   - Normal data members are initialized when an object of the class is created using the class constructor and exist until the object is garbage collected.

In summary, classes provide a template for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes. Static data members are shared among all instances of the class, while normal data members are unique to each object. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing and implementing Java applications.

## Reading Input and Parsing Values Using System.console()
Using `System.console()` in Java is another way to read input from the console. It's particularly useful for command-line applications. However, `System.console()` may return `null` if the application is not running in an environment that supports console access, such as in an `IDE` or when running as a background process. Here's how you can use it to read input:

```java
import java.io.Console;

public class ConsoleInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Console console = System.console();

        if (console != null) {
            // Reading a string
            String inputString = console.readLine("Enter a string: ");
            System.out.println("You entered: " + inputString);

            // Reading a password
            char[] passwordChars = console.readPassword("Enter your password: ");
            // Convert char array to string securely
            String password = new String(passwordChars);
            // Clearing the password array for security
            java.util.Arrays.fill(passwordChars, ' ');
            System.out.println("Password entered: " + password);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Console is not available.");
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example:
- `System.console()` returns a `Console` object if it's available, or `null` otherwise.
- We first check if `console` is not `null` before proceeding with input operations to avoid `NullPointerException`.
- We use `console.readLine()` to read a line of text input from the user.
- For reading passwords, `console.readPassword()` is used. This method returns a character array instead of a string to enhance security, as strings are immutable and can't be cleared from memory.

Remember that when using `System.console()`, you should ensure that your application runs in an environment where console access is available. Otherwise, you might encounter unexpected behavior. Additionally, keep in mind that `System.console()` is not available in all environments, such as when running Java code within an IDE or as a service.


## Wrapper Class Methods For Parsing Values And Strings
In Java, wrapper classes provide utility methods to parse strings into their corresponding primitive types, and vice versa. Here are the commonly used wrapper classes and their respective parse methods:

1. **`Integer` class:**
   - `parseInt(String s)`: Parses the string argument as a signed decimal integer.
   - `parseInt(String s, int radix)`: Parses the string argument as a signed integer in the specified radix (base).
   - `valueOf(String s)`: Returns an `Integer` object representing the integer value of the specified string.

2. **`Long` class:**
   - `parseLong(String s)`: Parses the string argument as a signed decimal long.
   - `parseLong(String s, int radix)`: Parses the string argument as a signed long in the specified radix (base).
   - `valueOf(String s)`: Returns a `Long` object representing the long value of the specified string.

3. **`Double` class:**
   - `parseDouble(String s)`: Parses the string argument as a double-precision floating-point number.
   - `valueOf(String s)`: Returns a `Double` object representing the double value of the specified string.

4. **`Float` class:**
   - `parseFloat(String s)`: Parses the string argument as a single-precision floating-point number.
   - `valueOf(String s)`: Returns a `Float` object representing the float value of the specified string.

5. **`Boolean` class:**
   - `parseBoolean(String s)`: Parses the string argument as a boolean.
   - `valueOf(String s)`: Returns a `Boolean` object representing the boolean value of the specified string.

Example usage:

```java
String intStr = "123";
int intValue = Integer.parseInt(intStr);

String doubleStr = "3.14";
double doubleValue = Double.parseDouble(doubleStr);

String boolStr = "true";
boolean boolValue = Boolean.parseBoolean(boolStr);
```

These methods are handy when you need to convert strings to primitive types for arithmetic operations or comparisons. They can also handle format validation and conversion errors gracefully by throwing `NumberFormatException` if the string cannot be parsed into the desired type.

## Exceptions And Exception Handling In JAVA

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of Java programming that allows developers to manage unexpected situations and errors that occur during program execution. Exceptions are objects that represent exceptional conditions that can occur during the execution of a program. Java provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions through its exception handling framework. Here's an overview:

1. **Types of Exceptions:**
   - **Checked Exceptions:** These are exceptions that the compiler forces you to handle. They extend `Exception` class but not `RuntimeException`. Examples include `IOException`, `SQLException`, etc.
   - **Unchecked Exceptions:** Also known as runtime exceptions, these are not required to be handled explicitly by the programmer. They extend `RuntimeException`. Examples include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, etc.
   - **Errors:** These are exceptional conditions that are not expected to be caught under normal circumstances. Examples include `OutOfMemoryError`, `StackOverflowError`, etc.

2. **Exception Handling Keywords:**
   - **try:** The `try` block encloses the code that may throw an exception.
   - **catch:** The `catch` block is used to handle the exception caught by the `try` block.
   - **finally:** The `finally` block is used to execute code irrespective of whether an exception is thrown or not. It's often used for cleanup tasks.
   - **throw:** The `throw` keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or block of code.
   - **throws:** The `throws` keyword is used in method signatures to indicate that a method may throw certain types of exceptions.

3. **Exception Handling Example:**
   ```java
   try {
       // Code that may throw an exception
       int result = 10 / 0;
   } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
       // Handling arithmetic exception
       System.out.println("Division by zero error: " + e.getMessage());
   } finally {
       // Cleanup or resource release code
       System.out.println("Finally block executed.");
   }
   ```

4. **Handling Exceptions in Methods:**
   - A method can declare that it throws certain exceptions using the `throws` keyword in its signature.
   - Calling methods that declare checked exceptions requires handling them using `try-catch` blocks or declaring them to be thrown again in the calling method.

5. **Custom Exception Classes:**
   Developers can create their own exception classes by extending existing exception classes or directly subclassing `Exception` or `RuntimeException`.

6. **Best Practices:**
   - Handle exceptions at an appropriate level of abstraction.
   - Provide meaningful error messages or logging information.
   - Close resources properly in the `finally` block to prevent resource leaks.
   - Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and runtime exceptions for programming errors or conditions that should not normally occur.

Exception handling is essential for writing robust and maintainable Java applications. It helps in gracefully handling errors and prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly.


## Scanner Class In JAVA
The `Scanner` class in Java is widely used for parsing primitive types and strings from input streams, such as `System.in`, files, or strings. It provides various methods to read different types of input and allows you to set custom delimiters. The `nextLine()` method is particularly useful for reading entire lines of text, and understanding its behavior with respect to line breaks is important. Here's how you can use `Scanner`, delimiters, and `nextLine()` method:

1. **Using `Scanner` class:**

   ```java
   import java.util.Scanner;

   public class ScannerExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

           // Reading an integer
           System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
           int num = scanner.nextInt();
           System.out.println("You entered: " + num);

           // Reading a double
           System.out.print("Enter a double: ");
           double d = scanner.nextDouble();
           System.out.println("You entered: " + d);

           // Reading a string
           System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
           String str = scanner.next(); // Reads only one word
           System.out.println("You entered: " + str);

           scanner.close();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Setting custom delimiters:**

   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner("1,2,3,4,5").useDelimiter(",");
   while (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
       int num = scanner.nextInt();
       System.out.println("Parsed number: " + num);
   }
   scanner.close();
   ```

3. **Using `nextLine()` method and handling line breaks:**

   The `nextLine()` method reads the input until it encounters a newline character (`\n`) or reaches the end of the line. It returns the input as a string, excluding the newline character. If `nextLine()` is called after methods like `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc., it might consume the remaining newline character left by those methods.

   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   System.out.print("Enter a line of text: ");
   String line = scanner.nextLine();
   System.out.println("You entered: " + line);
   scanner.close();
   ```

   If you face issues like skipping input after using `nextLine()`, it's often because of the newline character left in the buffer. To handle this, you can consume the newline character after reading other types of input:

   ```java
   Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
   System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
   int num = scanner.nextInt();
   scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline character
   System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
   String str = scanner.nextLine();
   System.out.println("You entered: " + num + " and " + str);
   scanner.close();
   ```

   Here, `scanner.nextLine()` is used to consume the newline character left after `scanner.nextInt()`. This ensures that the subsequent `scanner.nextLine()` call reads the expected input correctly.

   ## Buffered Reader And It's Uses
   `BufferedReader` is a class in Java that reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. It inherits functionality from the `Reader` class and is particularly useful for reading large amounts of text efficiently. Here's an overview of `BufferedReader` and its common uses:

1. **Efficient Reading:**
   `BufferedReader` reads text from an underlying `Reader` efficiently by buffering input. This reduces the number of I/O operations, making it faster compared to reading character by character directly from the input source.

2. **Reading Text:**
   It provides methods for reading text, characters, arrays, and lines from the input stream. Some commonly used methods include `read()`, `readLine()`, and `read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`.

3. **Reading Lines:**
   The `readLine()` method reads a line of text from the input stream, returning it as a `String`. It reads until it encounters a newline character (`'\n'`) or reaches the end of the stream.

4. **Example Usage:**
   ```java
   import java.io.BufferedReader;
   import java.io.FileReader;
   import java.io.IOException;

   public class BufferedReaderExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("example.txt"))) {
               String line;
               while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                   System.out.println(line);
               }
           } catch (IOException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   In this example, `BufferedReader` is used to read text from a file named "example.txt". It reads each line of text until the end of the file is reached, printing each line to the console.

5. **Closing the Reader:**
   It's important to close the `BufferedReader` after use to release resources properly. Using a try-with-resources statement ensures that the reader is closed automatically, even if an exception occurs.

6. **Buffer Size:**
   By default, `BufferedReader` uses an internal buffer size for efficiency. However, you can specify a custom buffer size when creating an instance of `BufferedReader` to optimize performance based on your application's requirements.

`BufferedReader` is commonly used for reading text files, configuration files, network streams, and any other text-based input sources in Java applications. Its efficient buffering mechanism makes it suitable for reading large amounts of text with improved performance compared to reading character by character.

## Format Specifiers In JAVA
In Java, format specifiers are used in conjunction with the `printf()` and `format()` methods of the `PrintStream` and `Formatter` classes, respectively, to control the formatting of output strings. Format specifiers define how data should be formatted when it is inserted into a formatted string.

The general syntax for format specifiers is:

```
%[flags][width][.precision]conversion
```

Here's what each part of the format specifier represents:

1. **Flags (Optional):**
   - Flags modify the output format according to specific requirements. Some common flags include:
     - `-`: Left-justifies the output.
     - `+`: Includes a sign (+ or -) for numeric values.
     - `0`: Pads numeric values with leading zeros.
     - `,`: Adds locale-specific grouping separators for numeric values.

2. **Width (Optional):**
   - Width specifies the minimum number of characters to be printed. If the data requires fewer characters, it is padded with spaces (or zeros if the `0` flag is used) to meet the specified width.

3. **Precision (Optional):**
   - Precision is used with floating-point numbers to control the number of digits after the decimal point. It specifies the maximum number of digits to be printed after the decimal point.

4. **Conversion (Required):**
   - Conversion specifies how the data should be formatted. Common conversions include:
     - `d` or `i`: Integer.
     - `f`: Floating-point number (decimal format).
     - `s`: String.
     - `b`: Boolean.
     - `c`: Character.
     - `x` or `X`: Integer formatted as hexadecimal (lowercase or uppercase).

### Example:
```java
int intValue = 42;
double doubleValue = 3.14159;
String stringValue = "Hello";

System.out.printf("Integer: %d%n", intValue); // Output: Integer: 42
System.out.printf("Floating-point: %.2f%n", doubleValue); // Output: Floating-point: 3.14
System.out.printf("String: %s%n", stringValue); // Output: String: Hello
```

In this example:
- `%d` is the format specifier for integers.
- `%.2f` specifies a floating-point number with two decimal places.
- `%s` is used for strings.

Format specifiers provide a flexible way to control the formatting of output in Java, allowing you to format data according to specific requirements in a concise and readable manner.
