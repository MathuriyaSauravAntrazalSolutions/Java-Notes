## Composition In JAVA
In object-oriented programming, composition is a design principle `where a class contains one or more objects of other classes as member variables`. This allows you to create more complex objects by combining simpler ones. Composition enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and facilitates building complex systems from smaller, more manageable components.

### Key Concepts of Composition:

1. **Has-A Relationship:**
   - Composition establishes a "has-a" relationship between classes. For example, a `Car` class may have a `Engine` class as a member, indicating that a car has an engine.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Composition promotes encapsulation by hiding the internal details of objects. The containing class interacts with the composed objects through their public interfaces.

3. **Code Reuse:**
   - By composing objects, you can reuse existing classes without duplicating code. This leads to more maintainable and modular code.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Composition allows for greater flexibility in designing and modifying classes. You can easily change the behavior of a class by swapping out its composed objects.

### Example of Composition:

Consider a `Car` class composed of an `Engine` and `Wheel` objects:

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        // Logic to start the engine
    }
}

class Wheel {
    void rotate() {
        // Logic to rotate the wheel
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    private Wheel[] wheels;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine();
        this.wheels = new Wheel[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            this.wheels[i] = new Wheel();
        }
    }

    public void start() {
        engine.start();
    }

    public void drive() {
        for (Wheel wheel : wheels) {
            wheel.rotate();
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example:
- The `Car` class contains an `Engine` object and an array of `Wheel` objects.
- The `Car` class interacts with its composed objects (`Engine` and `Wheel`) through their public interfaces.
- This composition allows the `Car` class to reuse existing `Engine` and `Wheel` classes, promoting code reuse and modularity.

### Benefits of Composition:

1. **Modularity:** Classes can be broken down into smaller, more manageable components.
2. **Flexibility:** Composed objects can be easily replaced or modified without affecting the containing class.
3. **Code Reuse:** Existing classes can be reused to build new, more complex objects.
4. **Encapsulation:** Composed objects hide their internal details, promoting encapsulation and information hiding.

Composition is a fundamental concept in object-oriented design and is widely used to create complex systems from simpler, reusable components. By applying composition effectively, you can build flexible, modular, and maintainable software solutions.

Example:

```java
// product class and its child classes
public class Product {

    private String model;
    private String manufacturer;
    private int width;
    private int height;
    private int depth;

    public Product(String model, String manufacturer) {
        this.model = model;
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
    }
}

class Monitor extends Product {

    private int size;
    private String resolution;

    public Monitor(String model, String manufacturer) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
    }

    public Monitor(String model, String manufacturer, int size, String resolution) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
        this.size = size;
        this.resolution = resolution;
    }

    public void drawPixelAt(int x, int y, String color) {
        System.out.println(String.format(
                "Drawing pixel at %d,%d in color %s ", x, y, color));
    }
}

class Motherboard extends Product {

    private int ramSlots;
    private int cardSlots;
    private String bios;

    public Motherboard(String model, String manufacturer) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
    }

    public Motherboard(String model, String manufacturer, int ramSlots, int cardSlots,
                       String bios) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
        this.ramSlots = ramSlots;
        this.cardSlots = cardSlots;
        this.bios = bios;
    }

    public void loadProgram(String programName) {
        System.out.println("Program " + programName + " is now loading...");
    }
}

class ComputerCase extends Product {

    private String powerSupply;

    public ComputerCase(String model, String manufacturer) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
    }

    public ComputerCase(String model, String manufacturer, String powerSupply) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
        this.powerSupply = powerSupply;
    }

    public void pressPowerButton() {
        System.out.println("Power button pressed");
    }
}
```



```java
// personal computer class
public class PersonalComputer extends Product {

    private ComputerCase computerCase;
    private Monitor monitor;
    private Motherboard motherboard;

    public PersonalComputer(String model, String manufacturer,
                            ComputerCase computerCase, Monitor monitor,
                            Motherboard motherboard) {
        super(model, manufacturer);
        this.computerCase = computerCase;
        this.monitor = monitor;
        this.motherboard = motherboard;
    }

    private void drawLogo() {
        monitor.drawPixelAt(1200, 50, "yellow");
    }

    public void powerUp() {
        computerCase.pressPowerButton();
        drawLogo();
    }

//    public ComputerCase getComputerCase() {
//        return computerCase;
//    }
//
//    public Monitor getMonitor() {
//        return monitor;
//    }
//
//    public Motherboard getMotherboard() {
//        return motherboard;
//    }
}

```







## Inheritance vs Composition
Inheritance and composition are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming that allow you to model relationships between classes. Here's a comparison between the two with real-world examples:

### Inheritance:

1. **Definition:**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism where a subclass (derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from a superclass (base class). The subclass can extend or override the functionality of the superclass.
   
2. **Real-world Example:**
   - Consider a class hierarchy representing different types of vehicles:
     - `Vehicle` (Superclass)
       - `Car` (Subclass)
       - `Motorcycle` (Subclass)
   - Both `Car` and `Motorcycle` inherit common attributes and behaviors from `Vehicle`, such as `start()` and `stop()` methods.

3. **Usage:**
   - Use inheritance when there is an "is-a" relationship between classes, and the subclass shares a significant portion of the superclass's behavior and attributes.

### Composition:

1. **Definition:**
   - Composition is a design principle where a class contains one or more objects of other classes as member variables. It allows you to build complex objects by combining simpler ones.
   
2. **Real-world Example:**
   - Consider a `Car` class composed of various components:
     - `Engine`
     - `Wheels`
     - `Transmission`
   - Each component is a separate class, and the `Car` class contains instances of these classes as member variables.
   
3. **Usage:**
   - Use composition when there is a "has-a" relationship between classes, and the containing class needs to use or interact with the composed objects to achieve its functionality.

### Comparison:

1. **Relationship:**
   - In inheritance, there is an "is-a" relationship between classes, where a subclass is a specialized version of its superclass.
   - In composition, there is a "has-a" relationship between classes, where a class contains instances of other classes as its components.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - Inheritance creates a tight coupling between the subclass and superclass, making it less flexible if the superclass changes.
   - Composition offers more flexibility because it relies on interfaces rather than concrete implementations, allowing you to easily change or swap out composed objects.

3. **Code Reuse:**
   - Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing subclasses to inherit behaviors and attributes from superclasses.
   - Composition promotes code reuse by allowing you to reuse existing classes as components in new classes.

4. **Complexity:**
   - Inheritance can lead to deep class hierarchies, which may become complex and hard to maintain.
   - Composition simplifies class structure by breaking down complex objects into smaller, manageable components.

In summary, inheritance is suitable for modeling "is-a" relationships and sharing behavior between classes, while composition is suitable for building complex objects from simpler components and promoting code reuse. The choice between inheritance and composition depends on the specific requirements of your design and the nature of the relationships between classes.

#### Always try to use composition first before Inharitance


```java
// Main Function for above functionality
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ComputerCase theCase = new ComputerCase("2208", "Dell",
                "240");
        Monitor theMonitor = new Monitor("27inch Beast", "Acer",
                27, "2540 x 1440");
        Motherboard theMotherboard = new Motherboard("BJ-200", "Asus",
                4, 6, "v2.44");
        PersonalComputer thePC = new PersonalComputer("2208", "Dell",
                theCase, theMonitor, theMotherboard);

//        thePC.getMonitor().drawPixelAt(10, 10, "red");
//        thePC.getMotherboard().loadProgram("Windows OS");
//        thePC.getComputerCase().pressPowerButton();

        thePC.powerUp();
    }
}
```



## Encapsulation In JAVA
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, along with inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. Encapsulation allows you to control the access to the data and hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world.

### Key Principles of Encapsulation:

1. **Data Hiding:**
   - Encapsulation hides the internal state of an object from direct access by external code. Access to the object's data is typically restricted to methods defined within the class.

2. **Access Control:**
   - Encapsulation allows you to specify access levels for members (fields and methods) of a class, such as public, private, protected, or package-private, to control who can access them.

3. **Information Hiding:**
   - Encapsulation enables information hiding by exposing only the necessary details of an object's behavior while keeping the implementation details hidden. This reduces complexity and improves maintainability.

4. **Modularity:**
   - Encapsulation promotes modularity by bundling related data and methods into cohesive units (classes). This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the code.

### Benefits of Encapsulation:

1. **Data Protection:**
   - Encapsulation protects the integrity of an object's data by preventing unauthorized access and modification.

2. **Flexibility:**
   - Encapsulation allows you to change the internal implementation of a class without affecting the code that uses it, as long as the public interface remains the same.

3. **Code Reusability:**
   - Encapsulation promotes code reuse by providing a standardized interface for interacting with objects, making it easier to use and extend existing classes.

4. **Security:**
   - Encapsulation enhances security by hiding sensitive data and exposing only the necessary functionality through well-defined interfaces.

### Example of Encapsulation:

```java
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private double salary;

    // Constructor and methods for accessing and modifying data (getters and setters)
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }
}
```

In the above example:
- The `Employee` class encapsulates the attributes (`name`, `age`, `salary`) and provides public methods (`getters` and `setters`) to access and modify them.
- The data members (`name`, `age`, `salary`) are declared as `private` to restrict direct access from outside the class, promoting data hiding and information hiding.
- Access to these members is controlled through methods, allowing validation, error-checking, and maintaining the integrity of the data.

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Java and plays a crucial role in building maintainable, secure, and extensible software systems. It helps manage complexity, enhance code quality, and improve overall software design.

## Polymorphism In JAVA
Polymorphism is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method invocation in different ways. In Java, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass through inheritance, leading to flexibility, extensibility, and code reuse.

### Types of Polymorphism in Java:

1. **Compile-Time/Static Polymorphism (Method Overloading):**
   - Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. The compiler determines which method to invoke based on the number and type of arguments passed.
   ```java
   class Calculator {
       int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       double add(double a, double b) {
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Run-Time/Dynamic Polymorphism (Method Overriding):**
   - Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The decision of which method to invoke is made at runtime based on the actual object type.
   
   - You can use `final` keyword to make a method non-overrideable in Java.

   - You `can not` over-ride `static methods`
   ```java
   class Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Some generic sound");
       }
       // Cant override this method in child classes
       final void fun(){
            System.out.println("Make Fun");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void makeSound() {
           System.out.println("Woof!");
       }
   }
   ```

### Example of Polymorphism in Java:

```java
class Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a shape");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle();
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle();

        circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle
        rectangle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle
    }
}
```

In the example above:
- The `Shape` class defines a method `draw()`, which is overridden in its subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
- In the `Main` class, objects of type `Circle` and `Rectangle` are instantiated and assigned to variables of type `Shape`.
- Despite being declared as `Shape`, the actual objects are of type `Circle` and `Rectangle`, so the `draw()` method of the respective subclass is invoked at runtime (dynamic binding).

Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in Java programs by allowing methods to be overridden and invoked based on the actual object type at runtime. It promotes code reuse, improves maintainability, and supports the implementation of complex, hierarchical class structures.

Another Example: 

```java
public class Movie {

    private String title;

    public Movie(String title) {
        this.title = title;
    }

    public void watchMovie() {

        String instanceType = this.getClass().getSimpleName();
        System.out.println(title + " is a " + instanceType + " film");
    }
}

class Adventure extends Movie {

    public Adventure(String title) {
        super(title);
    }

    @Override
    public void watchMovie() {
        super.watchMovie();
        System.out.printf(".. %s%n".repeat(3),
                "Pleasant Scene",
                "Scary Music",
                "Something Bad Happens");
    }
}

class Comedy extends Movie {

    public Comedy(String title) {
        super(title);
    }

    @Override
    public void watchMovie() {
        super.watchMovie();
        System.out.printf(".. %s%n".repeat(3),
                "Something funny happens",
                "Something even funnier happens",
                "Happy Ending");
    }
}

class ScienceFiction extends Movie {

    public ScienceFiction(String title) {
        super(title);
    }

    @Override
    public void watchMovie() {
        super.watchMovie();
        System.out.printf(".. %s%n".repeat(3),
                "Bad Aliens do Bad Stuff",
                "Space Guys Chase Aliens",
                "Planet Blows Up");
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Movie theMovie = new Adventure("Star Wars");
        theMovie.watchMovie();
    }
}


```

## Casting In Classes In JAVA
In Java, casting refers to the process of converting an object from one data type to another. This can be necessary when you want to treat an object of one class as if it were an object of another class, provided that an inheritance relationship exists between the two classes. There are two types of casting in Java:

1. **Upcasting (Implicit Casting):**
   - Upcasting involves casting an object from a subclass type to a superclass type. It is implicitly performed by the compiler and does not require an explicit cast operator.
   - Upcasting is always safe and does not require a cast operator because every instance of a subclass is also an instance of its superclass.
   ```java
   Superclass obj1 = new Subclass(); // Upcasting
   ```

2. **Downcasting (Explicit Casting):**
   - Downcasting involves casting an object from a superclass type to a subclass type. It is explicitly performed by the programmer using the cast operator `(Subclass)`.
   - Downcasting may result in a `ClassCastException` at runtime if the object being cast is not actually an instance of the target subclass.
   ```java
   Subclass obj2 = (Subclass) obj1; // Downcasting
   ```

### Example:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Some generic sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }

    void fetch() {
        System.out.println("Fetching...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog(); // Upcasting
        animal.makeSound(); // Output: "Woof!"

        // Downcasting
        Dog dog = (Dog) animal;
        dog.makeSound(); // Output: "Woof!"
        dog.fetch(); // Output: "Fetching..."
    }
}
```

In the example above:
- An object of type `Dog` is upcasted to type `Animal` (`Animal animal = new Dog();`).
- Then, the same object is downcasted back to type `Dog` (`Dog dog = (Dog) animal;`).
- The downcast allows access to methods specific to the `Dog` class (`fetch()`).

It's important to note that downcasting should be used carefully to avoid `ClassCastException`. You can use the `instanceof` operator to check if an object is an instance of a particular class before performing downcasting.

## Var Keyword In JAVA
The `var` keyword in Java was introduced in Java 10 as part of the local variable type inference feature. It allows you to declare local variables without explicitly specifying the variable's data type. Instead, the compiler infers the data type based on the initialization expression.

### Key Points about the `var` Keyword:

1. **Local Variable Type Inference:**
   - The `var` keyword is used for local variable declarations only, such as variables declared within methods or code blocks.
   - It cannot be used for method parameters, constructor parameters, or return types.

2. **Type Inference:**
   - When you use `var`, the Java compiler `infers` the type of the variable based on the initialization expression. The inferred type becomes the actual type of the variable at `compile time`.
   - The inferred type must be clear and unambiguous from the initialization expression. Otherwise, the compiler will produce a compilation error.

3. **Readability and Conciseness:**
   - The use of `var` can make code more concise and readable, especially in cases where the type is obvious from the initialization expression.
   - However, overuse of `var` can reduce code clarity, so it should be used judiciously.

### Example Usage of the `var` Keyword:

```java
// Without var
String name = "John";

// With var
var age = 30; // Inferred type: int
var salary = 50000.0; // Inferred type: double
var isValid = true; // Inferred type: boolean
```

In the above example, the types of the variables `age`, `salary`, and `isValid` are inferred by the compiler based on the initialization expressions. The inferred types are `int`, `double`, and `boolean`, respectively.

### Guidelines for Using `var`:

1. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Even though `var` reduces verbosity, it's essential to use descriptive variable names to maintain code clarity and readability.

2. **Avoid Excessive Use:**
   - Use `var` where it improves code readability and reduces verbosity. Avoid using it excessively, especially in cases where it makes code less understandable.

3. **Maintain Consistency:**
   - Choose a consistent style within your codebase regarding the use of `var`. Either use it consistently where appropriate or avoid it entirely if it doesn't fit the coding style.

4. **Be Mindful of Compatibility:**
   - Be aware that using `var` makes your code Java 10 (or later) specific. If your code needs to be compatible with older Java versions, you should avoid using `var`.

Overall, the `var` keyword provides a way to reduce boilerplate code and improve code conciseness in Java, but it should be used judiciously to maintain code readability and consistency.


## Check Instance Type At RunTime using instanceof
In Java, the `instanceof` operator is used to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class or implements an interface. It returns `true` if the object is an instance of the specified class or implements the specified interface; otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here's the syntax of the `instanceof` operator:

```java
object instanceof Class
```

or

```java
object instanceof Interface
```

Where:
- `object` is the object being tested.
- `Class` is the name of the class you are testing against.
- `Interface` is the name of the interface you are testing against.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of the `instanceof` operator:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = "Hello";
        
        if (obj instanceof String) {
            System.out.println("obj is an instance of String");
        } else {
            System.out.println("obj is not an instance of String");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
obj is an instance of String
```

In this example, the `instanceof` operator is used to check whether the `obj` is an instance of the `String` class. Since `obj` holds a string object, the condition evaluates to `true`, and the corresponding message is printed.

#### Pattern Matching In instanceof Operator
Pattern matching for the `instanceof` operator is a feature introduced in Java 16 as a preview feature and further refined in Java 17, which allows you to combine a type check and a cast into a single, concise expression. This feature simplifies code and improves readability by eliminating the need for redundant casts.

Here's the syntax for pattern matching using the `instanceof` operator:

```java
if (object instanceof ClassName identifier) {
    // code block using identifier
} else {
    // code block if object is not an instance of ClassName
}
```

or

```java
if (object instanceof InterfaceName identifier) {
    // code block using identifier
} else {
    // code block if object does not implement InterfaceName
}
```

Where:
- `object` is the object being tested.
- `ClassName` is the name of the class you are testing against.
- `InterfaceName` is the name of the interface you are testing against.
- `identifier` is the name of the variable to which the object is cast if the test is successful.

Here's an example demonstrating pattern matching using the `instanceof` operator:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = "Hello";

        if (obj instanceof String str) {
            System.out.println("Length of the string is: " + str.length());
        } else {
            System.out.println("obj is not an instance of String");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Length of the string is: 5
```

In this example, the `instanceof` operator is used to check whether `obj` is an instance of the `String` class. If it is, the object is automatically cast to a `String` and bound to the variable `str`. Then, the length of the string is printed using the `str` variable. If `obj` is not an instance of `String`, the else block is executed.
