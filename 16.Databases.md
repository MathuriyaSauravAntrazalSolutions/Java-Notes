To install SQLite on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. **Download SQLite**: Go to the SQLite website (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) and download the precompiled binaries for Windows. You have the option to download either the SQLite Tools package, which includes the command-line shell and other utilities, or the amalgamation package, which contains source code files.

2. **Extract the Files**: Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a directory on your computer. You can use a built-in tool like Windows Explorer or a third-party utility like 7-Zip. And Add in your `C Drive programms` or `user directory`.

3. **Add SQLite to PATH (Optional)**: To use SQLite from any directory in the command prompt, you can add the directory containing the SQLite executable to the system PATH environment variable. This step is optional but can be convenient.

4. **Test the Installation**: Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the SQLite files. Run the SQLite command-line shell by executing the `sqlite3` executable.

5. **Verify SQLite Installation**: Once the SQLite command-line shell is running, you can verify the installation by typing `.version` and pressing Enter. This command should display the version of SQLite installed on your system.

Here's a summary of the steps:

- Download SQLite from the official website.
- Extract the downloaded files to a directory on your computer.
- (Optional) Add the directory containing SQLite to the system PATH environment variable.
- Test the installation by running the SQLite command-line shell.
- Verify the installation by checking the version of SQLite.

Following these steps should allow you to install SQLite on your Windows system and start using it for database operations.

## Some Commands Of SQLIte
SQLite provides a set of commands that you can use within the SQLite command-line shell to interact with databases. Here are some commonly used SQLite commands:

**`Note:`** SQLite is `Case-Sensetive`. can use `collate nocase` during column creation to make that column case-insensetive.

1. **`.help`**: Display a list of available commands.

2. **`.quit` or `.exit`**: Quit the SQLite command-line shell.

3. **`.databases`**: List all attached databases.

4. **`.tables`**: List all tables in the current database.

5. **`.schema TABLE_NAME`**: Show the schema (structure) of a specific table.

6. **`.header ON|OFF`**: Turn column headers on or off in query results.

7. **`.mode MODE`**: Set the output mode. Common modes include `column` (tabular output), `line` (one value per line), and `csv` (comma-separated values).

8. **`.open DATABASE_FILE`**: Open or attach to a specific SQLite database file.

9. **`.read FILE_NAME`**: Read and execute SQL commands from a file.

10. **`.save FILE_NAME`**: Save the current database to a file.

11. **`.output FILE_NAME`**: Redirect query results to a file.

12. **`.import FILE_NAME TABLE_NAME`**: Import data from a CSV file into a table.

13. **`.header ON|OFF`**: Toggle display of column headers in query results.

14. **`.nullvalue STRING`**: Set the string to display for `NULL` values in query results.

15. **`.echo ON|OFF`**: Toggle displaying SQL commands before execution.

16. **`.show`**: Show the current settings.

17. **`.vacuum`**: Rebuild the entire database file, compacting it and optimizing its performance.

18. **`sqlite3 test.db`**: will select for use `test named` database if not available than will create one.

19. **`.headers on`**: will show the column name before the start of data.

20. **`.database`**: will show the available database.

21. **`.table`**: will show the available table.

22. **`.schema`**: will show the current table schema.

23. **`.backup testbackup`**: will store the backup of current state of db and tables.

24. **`.restore testbackup`**: will change the current database state to previous backup state.

25. **`.dump`**: shows `transactions` queries with data tom insert data into other place;


`use single quote while inserting data`

These are just some of the commands available in SQLite. You can access the full list of commands and their descriptions by typing `.help` within the SQLite command-line shell.

Remember that most of these commands are specific to the SQLite command-line shell and are not part of the SQL standard. When interacting with SQLite databases from a programming language such as Python, Java, or C++, you'll use SQL commands to perform database operations.

## AutoIncrement In SQL
Autoincrement in SQL is a feature that automatically generates a unique numeric value for a column whenever a new row is inserted into a table. This is commonly used for primary key columns to ensure each row has a unique identifier.

In SQL, the autoincrement feature is often implemented using an identity column (in Microsoft SQL Server), a serial column (in PostgreSQL), or an auto-increment column (in MySQL). Here's how you would define an autoincrement column in different SQL dialects:

1. **MySQL**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
);
```

2. **PostgreSQL**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
);
```

3. **SQLite**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    ...
);
```

4. **Microsoft SQL Server**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    ...
);
```

In each of these examples, the `id` column is designated as an autoincrement column. When a new row is inserted into the table and no value is provided for the `id` column, the database system automatically assigns a unique value to it.

It's important to note that not all database systems use the same syntax for autoincrement columns, so you should consult the documentation specific to the database system you're using. Additionally, autoincrement columns should typically be used for primary key columns or other columns where a unique identifier is required.

## MYSQL JDBC Connection 
To use MySQL JDBC Connector in Java, you need to follow these steps:
[Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0o_VTxImVk)

1. **Download MySQL JDBC Driver**: First, download the MySQL JDBC driver from the official MySQL website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/). Choose the appropriate version based on your MySQL server version.

2. **Add MySQL JDBC Driver to your Project**: Once downloaded, add the MySQL JDBC driver JAR file to your Java project's classpath. You can do this by including the JAR file in your project's build path or by copying it into the `lib` directory of your project.

3. **Write Java Code to Connect to MySQL Database**: Write Java code to connect to your MySQL database using the JDBC driver. Below is an example of how to create a MySQL database and connect to it using JDBC:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class CreateDB {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        try {
            // Step 1: Register JDBC driver
            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
            
            // Step 2: Open a connection
            String jdbcUrl = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/";
            String username = "root";
            String password = "your_password";
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, username, password);
            
            // Step 3: Execute a query to create a database
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            String sqlCreateDB = "CREATE DATABASE mydatabase";
            stmt.executeUpdate(sqlCreateDB);
            System.out.println("Database created successfully");
            
        } catch (SQLException se) {
            // Handle errors for JDBC
            se.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle errors for Class.forName
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Finally block used to close resources
            try {
                if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
            try {
                if (conn != null) conn.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/"` with your MySQL server's connection URL, and `"your_password"` with your MySQL server password.

This example will create a new database named `mydatabase` on your MySQL server. Ensure that your MySQL server is running and accessible before executing this code.

Remember to handle exceptions and close the database connection properly in a real-world application.


## JDBC Methods And Examples
In Java JDBC, the `Statement` interface is used to execute SQL statements against a database. There are three main types of statements: `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`. Here's an example of how to use `Statement` and `ResultSet` to execute queries and retrieve results:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class JDBCDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;
        ResultSet rs = null;
        try {
            // Step 1: Establish a connection to the database
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase", "username", "password");

            // Step 2: Create a Statement object
            stmt = conn.createStatement();

            // Step 3: Execute a query
            String sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM employees";
            rs = stmt.executeQuery(sqlQuery);

            // Step 4: Process the ResultSet
            while (rs.next()) {
                int id = rs.getInt("id");
                String name = rs.getString("name");
                int age = rs.getInt("age");
                System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
            }

        } catch (SQLException se) {
            // Handle errors for JDBC
            se.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Step 5: Close resources
            try {
                if (rs != null) rs.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
            try {
                if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
            try {
                if (conn != null) conn.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We establish a connection to the MySQL database using `DriverManager.getConnection()`.
2. We create a `Statement` object using `conn.createStatement()`.
3. We execute a query using `stmt.executeQuery()`, which returns a `ResultSet` containing the results of the query.
4. We iterate over the `ResultSet` using `rs.next()` and retrieve values using `rs.getInt()`, `rs.getString()`, etc.
5. Finally, we close the resources (`ResultSet`, `Statement`, `Connection`) in the `finally` block to release them properly.

The `executeUpdate()` method of the `Statement` interface is used to execute SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language) statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. It returns the number of rows affected by the query. Here's how you can use it:

```java
String sqlUpdate = "UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE age > 30";
int rowsUpdated = stmt.executeUpdate(sqlUpdate);
System.out.println("Rows updated: " + rowsUpdated);
```

This will update the `salary` of employees older than 30 by increasing it by 10%. The number of rows updated will be printed to the console.

Remember to handle exceptions properly and close resources after use to avoid resource leaks.

## Set AUto Commit
In the context of Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), `setAutoCommit()` is a method provided by the `Connection` interface. It allows you to control whether JDBC commits transactions automatically after each individual SQL statement execution or whether to require manual commit by the application.

When `autoCommit` is set to `true`, each SQL statement is committed immediately after it is executed, effectively starting and ending a transaction for each statement. This is the default behavior of most JDBC connections. 

When `autoCommit` is set to `false`, the application is responsible for explicitly committing or rolling back transactions using the `commit()` and `rollback()` methods of the `Connection` interface. This mode allows you to group multiple SQL statements into a single transaction.

Here's how you can use `setAutoCommit()`:

```java
// Assume 'conn' is a Connection object obtained from DriverManager.getConnection()

// Enable auto-commit mode
conn.setAutoCommit(true);

// Disable auto-commit mode
conn.setAutoCommit(false);
```

Example usage with manual commit:

```java
try {
    conn.setAutoCommit(false); // Disable auto-commit mode
    
    // Perform multiple SQL statements within a single transaction
    stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John', 30)");
    stmt.executeUpdate("UPDATE employees SET age = age + 1 WHERE name = 'John'");
    
    conn.commit(); // Commit the transaction
    
} catch (SQLException e) {
    conn.rollback(); // Rollback the transaction if an exception occurs
    e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
    conn.setAutoCommit(true); // Restore auto-commit mode
}
```

In this example, the transaction consists of inserting a new record into the `employees` table and then updating the age of the employee named 'John'. If any exception occurs during the transaction, the changes made by both SQL statements are rolled back using `rollback()`.
