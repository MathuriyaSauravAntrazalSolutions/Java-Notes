## Debugging 
Debugging Java code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is made possible through various extensions. Here's a general guide on how to set up debugging for Java in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
   Ensure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK, which is also popular.

2. **Install Visual Studio Code**:
   If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Install Java Extension Pack**:
   The Java Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code provides essential tools for Java developers. You can install it from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) by searching for "Java Extension Pack" and clicking install.

4. **Set up the Java Development Kit (JDK) in Visual Studio Code**:
   In Visual Studio Code, go to File > Preferences > Settings (or press Ctrl+,) to open the settings. Search for "Java Home" and set the path to your JDK installation directory.

5. **Create a Java Project**:
   Create a Java project or open an existing one in Visual Studio Code. You can create a new project using Maven, Gradle, or just create a folder and start coding.

6. **Create a Debug Configuration**:
   Open the file you want to debug in Visual Studio Code. Then, navigate to the Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D), and click on the gear icon to create a new launch configuration. Choose "Java" as the environment.

7. **Set Breakpoints**:
   In your Java code, set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers where you want to pause execution.

8. **Start Debugging**:
   Now, you can start debugging by clicking the green play button in the Debug view, or by pressing F5. This will launch your Java program in debug mode, and it will pause execution at the breakpoints you set.

9. **Debugging Controls**:
   Once your program is paused at a breakpoint, you can use the debugging controls such as step over, step into, step out, continue, etc., to navigate through your code and inspect variables.

10. **Inspect Variables**:
    You can inspect the values of variables by hovering over them in your code, or by viewing them in the Debug Console or Variables view.

11. **Stop Debugging**:
    To stop debugging, either terminate the debug session by clicking the red square button in the Debug view or press Shift+F5.

By following these steps, you should be able to debug your Java code effectively using Visual Studio Code.

In Java, "watchpoints" refer to a debugging feature that allows developers to monitor the value of a variable or an expression and pause the program execution whenever the value changes. This feature is particularly useful when you want to track the behavior of a specific variable or expression during program execution.

When you set a watchpoint on a variable or expression, the debugger continuously monitors its value. If the value changes while the program is running, the debugger interrupts the program execution and allows you to inspect the state of the program at that point.

Watchpoints are helpful for identifying unexpected changes in variables or expressions, understanding how data flows through your program, and debugging complex logic or algorithms.

Here's how you can set a watchpoint in Java using a debugger like the one provided by Visual Studio Code or any other IDE:

1. **Open the Debugger**: Start debugging your Java program using your preferred debugger (e.g., Visual Studio Code debugger, IntelliJ IDEA debugger, Eclipse debugger).

2. **Locate the Variable or Expression**: Identify the variable or expression you want to monitor. This could be a local variable, a field of an object, or any expression that evaluates to a value.

3. **Set the Watchpoint**: In the debugger's interface, there should be an option to set a watchpoint. Typically, you right-click on the variable or expression you want to watch and select an option like "Add Watch" or "Toggle Watchpoint".

4. **Configure Watchpoint Options** (if available): Some debuggers allow you to configure additional options for the watchpoint, such as conditions for pausing execution only when specific conditions are met (e.g., value equals a certain value).

5. **Run the Program**: Continue running your Java program in debug mode.

6. **Monitor Changes**: As your program executes, the debugger will pause execution whenever the value of the watched variable or expression changes.

7. **Inspect Program State**: When the debugger pauses execution due to a watchpoint being triggered, you can inspect the state of the program, including the current values of variables and the call stack, to understand why the value changed.

8. **Continue Debugging**: After analyzing the program state, you can continue debugging by stepping through the code or resuming program execution.

Watchpoints are a powerful debugging tool that can help you identify and troubleshoot issues related to variable values and program state during runtime. They are particularly valuable in scenarios where traditional breakpoints may not be sufficient for understanding program behavior.

## JUnit Testing In JAVA
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java that is widely used by developers for unit testing. It provides annotations to identify methods that specify a test case, as well as assertions for verifying the expected results of tests. Here's a basic guide on how to perform JUnit testing in Java:

1. **Add JUnit Dependency**:
   First, you need to include the JUnit dependency in your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>junit</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
       <version>4.13.1</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

   If you're using Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.13.1'
   ```

2. **Write Test Cases**:
   Create a Java class to hold your test cases. Test classes typically have a corresponding class that they test, with the same name but with `Test` appended. For example, if you have a class `Calculator`, you might have a test class named `CalculatorTest`. Each method in the test class annotated with `@Test` will be considered a test case. Here's an example:

   ```java
   import org.junit.Test;
   import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

   public class CalculatorTest {

       @Test
       public void testAddition() {
           Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
           int result = calculator.add(2, 3);
           assertEquals(5, result);
       }

       // More test cases can be added here
   }
   ```

3. **Write the Class to be Tested**:
   Create the class that you want to test. In our example, it's `Calculator`.

   ```java
   public class Calculator {

       public int add(int a, int b) {
           return a + b;
       }

       // More methods can be added here
   }
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**:
   You can run the tests in your IDE or using build tools like Maven or Gradle. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, there are built-in features to run JUnit tests. If you're using Maven, you can run tests with the command `mvn test`. If you're using Gradle, you can run tests with the command `gradle test`.

5. **Interpret Results**:
   After running the tests, you'll see the results indicating which tests passed and which failed. If a test fails, you'll also see information about the failure, including the expected and actual values.

JUnit provides many more features beyond the basics described here, including parameterized tests, test suites, and more advanced assertions. Refer to the JUnit documentation for a comprehensive guide.

## JUnit Assertion In JAVA
In JUnit, assertions are used to verify the expected behavior of your code during unit testing. They allow you to express the expected outcome of a test case and compare it with the actual result obtained from running the code under test. JUnit provides a set of assertion methods in the `org.junit.Assert` class (or `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` in JUnit Jupiter) to facilitate these comparisons. Here's a brief overview of some commonly used assertion methods in JUnit:

1. **assertEquals(expected, actual)**:
   Compares whether the expected value is equal to the actual value. This assertion is used to verify if two objects are equal. Example:

   ```java
   assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3));
   ```

2. **assertTrue(boolean condition)**:
   Checks if the specified condition is true. Example:

   ```java
   assertTrue(result > 0);
   ```

3. **assertFalse(boolean condition)**:
   Checks if the specified condition is false. Example:

   ```java
   assertFalse(result == 0);
   ```

4. **assertNotNull(object)**:
   Verifies that the specified object reference is not null. Example:

   ```java
   assertNotNull(calculator);
   ```

5. **assertNull(object)**:
   Verifies that the specified object reference is null. Example:

   ```java
   assertNull(calculator.getResult());
   ```

6. **assertSame(expected, actual)**:
   Checks if two references point to the same object. Example:

   ```java
   assertSame(expectedList, actualList);
   ```

7. **assertNotSame(expected, actual)**:
   Checks if two references do not point to the same object. Example:

   ```java
   assertNotSame(notExpectedList, actualList);
   ```

These are just a few examples of assertion methods provided by JUnit. There are more assertion methods available, and you can choose the appropriate one based on what you need to verify in your test cases. In JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter), assertion methods are provided by the `Assertions` class under the `org.junit.jupiter.api` package, and the method names are slightly different but serve similar purposes.


Example:
```java
package com.timbuchalka;

/**
 * Created by timbuchalka on 20/11/16.
 */
public class BankAccount {

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private double balance;

    public static final int CHECKING = 1;
    public static final int SAVINGS = 2;

    private int accountType;

    public BankAccount(String firstName, String lastName, double balance, int typeOfAccount) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.accountType = typeOfAccount;
    }

    // The branch argument is true if the customer is performing the transaction
    // at a branch, with a teller.
    // It's false if the customer is performing the transaction at an ATM
    public double deposit(double amount, boolean branch) {
        balance += amount;
        return balance;
    }

    // The branch argument is true if the customer is performing the transaction
    // at a branch, with a teller.
    // It's false if the customer is performing the transaction at an ATM
    public double withdraw(double amount, boolean branch) {
        balance -= amount;
        return balance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public boolean isChecking() {
        return accountType == CHECKING;
    }

    // More methods that use firstName, lastName, and perform other functions

}


package com.timbuchalka;

import static junit.framework.TestCase.assertEquals;
import static junit.framework.TestCase.assertTrue;
import static junit.framework.TestCase.fail;

/**
 * Created by timbuchalka on 20/11/16.
 */
public class BankAccountTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void deposit() throws Exception {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Tim", "Buchalka", 1000.00, BankAccount.CHECKING);
        double balance = account.deposit(200.00, true);
        assertEquals(1200.00, balance, 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void withdraw() throws Exception {
        fail("This test has yet to be implemented");
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void getBalance_deposit() throws Exception {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Tim", "Buchalka", 1000.00, BankAccount.CHECKING);
        account.deposit(200.00, true);
        assertEquals(1200.00, account.getBalance(), 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void getBalance_withdraw() throws Exception {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Tim", "Buchalka", 1000.00, BankAccount.CHECKING);
        account.withdraw(200.00, true);
        assertEquals(800.00, account.getBalance(), 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void isChecking_true() {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount("Tim", "Buchalka", 1000.00, BankAccount.CHECKING);
        assertTrue("The account is NOT a checking account", account.isChecking());

    }

}

package com.timbuchalka;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("The application is running");
    }
}


```



## Before Class In JUnit
In JUnit, the `@BeforeClass` annotation is used to designate a method that should be run once before any of the test methods in the test class are executed. It is typically used for setup operations that need to be performed before running any tests in the class, such as initializing resources, setting up the environment, or performing any one-time setup tasks.

Here's how you can use `@BeforeClass` in JUnit:

```java
import org.junit.BeforeClass;
import org.junit.Test;

public class MyTestClass {

    @BeforeClass
    public static void setUpBeforeClass() throws Exception {
        // Code to set up resources or perform other one-time setup tasks
        System.out.println("Before class setup");
    }

    @Test
    public void testMethod1() {
        // Test method 1
        System.out.println("Test method 1");
    }

    @Test
    public void testMethod2() {
        // Test method 2
        System.out.println("Test method 2");
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `setUpBeforeClass` method is annotated with `@BeforeClass` and declared as `static void`. It will be executed once before any of the test methods in the test class `MyTestClass`.
- Inside `setUpBeforeClass`, you can perform setup operations that are common to all test methods in the class. This method will be invoked before any test methods are executed.
- The `testMethod1` and `testMethod2` are regular test methods annotated with `@Test`. They will be executed after the `setUpBeforeClass` method.

It's important to note that the `setUpBeforeClass` method must be declared as `public static void` and cannot accept any parameters, as it is invoked by JUnit's test runner before any test methods are instantiated or executed. Additionally, any exceptions thrown by the `setUpBeforeClass` method will cause the test class to fail initialization.

Example:
```java

package com.timbuchalka;

/**
 * Created by timbuchalka on 20/11/16.
 */
public class BankAccount {

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private double balance;

    public static final int CHECKING = 1;
    public static final int SAVINGS = 2;

    private int accountType;

    public BankAccount(String firstName, String lastName, double balance, int typeOfAccount) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.balance = balance;
        this.accountType = typeOfAccount;
    }

    // The branch argument is true if the customer is performing the transaction
    // at a branch, with a teller.
    // It's false if the customer is performing the transaction at an ATM
    public double deposit(double amount, boolean branch) {
        balance += amount;
        return balance;
    }

    // The branch argument is true if the customer is performing the transaction
    // at a branch, with a teller.
    // It's false if the customer is performing the transaction at an ATM
    public double withdraw(double amount, boolean branch) {
        if ((amount > 500.00) & !branch) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
        }

        balance -= amount;
        return balance;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    public boolean isChecking() {
        return accountType == CHECKING;
    }

    // More methods that use firstName, lastName, and perform other functions

}


package com.timbuchalka;

import static junit.framework.TestCase.*;

/**

public class BankAccountTest {

    private BankAccount account;
    private static int count;

    @org.junit.BeforeClass // executes only once
    public static void beforeClass() {
        System.out.println("This executes before any test cases. Count = " + count++);
    }

    }

    public void deposit() throws Exception {
        double balance = account.deposit(200.00, true);
        assertEquals(1200.00, balance, 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void withdraw_branch() throws Exception {
        double balance = account.withdraw(600.00, true);
        assertEquals(400.00, balance, 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void withdraw_notBranch() throws Exception {
        double balance = account.withdraw(600.00, false);
        assertEquals(400.00, balance, 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void getBalance_deposit() throws Exception {
        account.deposit(200.00, true);
        assertEquals(1200.00, account.getBalance(), 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void getBalance_withdraw() throws Exception {
        account.withdraw(200.00, true);
        assertEquals(800.00, account.getBalance(), 0);
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void isChecking_true() {
        assertTrue("The account is NOT a checking account", account.isChecking());
    }

    @org.junit.AfterClass // executes only once
    public static void afterClass() {
        System.out.println("This executes after any test cases. Count = " + count++);
    }

    @org.junit.After // run after every testcase
    public void teardown() {
        System.out.println("Count = " + count++);
    }

}

package com.timbuchalka;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("The application is running");
    }
}


```


## Exception Handling In JUnit In JAVA
Exception handling in JUnit tests involves verifying that methods throw the expected exceptions under certain conditions. JUnit provides built-in mechanisms to test for expected exceptions using annotations and assertion methods. Here's how you can handle exceptions in JUnit tests in Java:

1. **Using `@Test` Annotation with `expected` Attribute**:

   You can use the `@Test` annotation along with the `expected` attribute to specify that a test method is expected to throw a particular exception. Here's an example:

   ```java
   import org.junit.Test;

   public class ExceptionHandlingTest {

       @Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class)
       public void testDivideByZero() {
           int result = 10 / 0; // This should throw an ArithmeticException
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `testDivideByZero` method is annotated with `@Test(expected = ArithmeticException.class)`, indicating that it is expected to throw an `ArithmeticException` when dividing by zero.

2. **Using `assertThrows` Method**:

   JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5) introduced the `assertThrows` method, which provides a more flexible and expressive way to test for exceptions. Here's how you can use it:

   ```java
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;

   public class ExceptionHandlingTest {

       @Test
       public void testDivideByZero() {
           assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> {
               int result = 10 / 0; // This should throw an ArithmeticException
           });
       }
   }
   ```

   The `assertThrows` method takes the expected exception type and a `Executable` (typically a lambda expression) representing the code that is expected to throw the exception.

3. **Testing Exception Messages**:

   You can also verify the exception message along with the exception type. Here's an example using `assertThrows`:

   ```java
   import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
   import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
   
   public class ExceptionHandlingTest {
   
       @Test
       public void testIllegalArgumentException() {
           Throwable exception = assertThrows(IllegalArgumentException.class, () -> {
               throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid argument");
           });
           assertEquals("Invalid argument", exception.getMessage());
       }
   }
   ```

   This test verifies that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown with the message "Invalid argument".

These are some common approaches to handle exceptions in JUnit tests in Java. By using these techniques, you can ensure that your tests properly verify the behavior of your code under exceptional conditions.

## Parameterized Testing In JAVA
Parameterized testing in JUnit allows you to run the same test logic with different inputs. This is useful when you want to test a method or functionality with multiple sets of data. JUnit provides built-in support for parameterized tests, typically achieved using the `@ParameterizedTest` annotation.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform parameterized testing in Java using JUnit:

1. **Add JUnit Jupiter Dependency**:
   Ensure you have JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5) dependency added to your project. If you're using Maven, include the following dependency in your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
       <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
       <version>5.8.2</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

   If you're using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.8.2'
   ```

2. **Create Parameterized Test Class**:
   Create a test class and annotate it with `@RunWith(Parameterized.class)` or `@ExtendWith(ParameterizedTestExtension.class)` if you're using JUnit 4 or JUnit 5, respectively. Then, define the parameters and the method that provides these parameters.

3. **Define Test Data**:
   Create a method to provide the test data. This method should return a collection of arguments to be used in the parameterized tests. This could be an array, a list, or any other collection.

4. **Write Test Logic**:
   Write your test method(s) and use the provided parameters as input. Each parameterized test method will run multiple times, once for each set of parameters.

5. **Execute the Tests**:
   Run your parameterized tests, and JUnit will execute them with each set of provided parameters.

Here's an example illustrating parameterized testing in JUnit:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvSource;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class CalculatorTest {

    private Calculator calculator;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        calculator = new Calculator();
    }

    @ParameterizedTest
    @CsvSource({ "1, 1, 2", "2, 3, 5", "10, -5, 5" }) // CSV input: (operand1, operand2, expectedSum)
    public void testAdd(int operand1, int operand2, int expectedSum) {
        int actualSum = calculator.add(operand1, operand2);
        assertEquals(expectedSum, actualSum);
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Calculator` class has a method `add(int a, int b)` which adds two integers.
- The `CalculatorTest` class contains a parameterized test method `testAdd` annotated with `@ParameterizedTest`.
- Test data is provided using `@CsvSource`, where each row represents a set of parameters for a test case.
- The test method `testAdd` is executed three times, once for each set of parameters provided in the CSV source.

This is a basic example of parameterized testing in JUnit. You can use other sources like `@ValueSource`, `@MethodSource`, or custom sources to provide test data as per your requirement.

Example:
```java
package com.timbuchalka;

import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collection;

import static junit.framework.TestCase.assertEquals;

/**
 * Created by timbuchalka on 20/11/16.
 */
@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
public class BankAccountTestParameterized {

    private BankAccount account;
    private double amount;
    private boolean branch;
    private double expected;

    public BankAccountTestParameterized(double amount, boolean branch, double expected) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.branch = branch;
        this.expected = expected;
    }

    @org.junit.Before
    public void setup() {
        account = new BankAccount("Tim", "Buchalka", 1000.00, BankAccount.CHECKING);
        System.out.println("Running a test...");
    }

    @Parameterized.Parameters
    public static Collection<Object[]> testConditions() {
        return Arrays.asList(new Object[][] {
                {100.00, true, 1100.00},
                {200.00, true, 1200.00},
                {325.14, true, 1325.14},
                {489.33, true, 1489.33},
                {1000.00, true, 2000.00}
        });

    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void deposit() throws Exception {
        account.deposit(amount, branch);
        assertEquals(expected, account.getBalance(), .01);
    }

}

```
