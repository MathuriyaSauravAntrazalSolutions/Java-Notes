## What Is Regular Expression
A regular expression, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. In Java, regular expressions are represented by the `java.util.regex` package, which provides classes for pattern matching with regular expressions.

Regular expressions in Java can be used for various purposes, such as:

1. **String Search and Manipulation**: Regular expressions can be used to search, find, and manipulate strings based on patterns.

2. **Text Processing**: Regular expressions are handy for text processing tasks like validation, parsing, and extraction of specific information from text data.

3. **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions are widely used for pattern matching tasks, such as matching email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, etc.

In Java, you typically use the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package to work with regular expressions. Here's a basic example demonstrating the usage of regular expressions in Java:

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
        String pattern = "fox";

        // Compile the regular expression pattern
        Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);

        // Create a Matcher object
        Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(text);

        // Find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text
        if (matcher.find()) {
            System.out.println("Pattern found at index: " + matcher.start());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Pattern not found");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Pattern found at index: 16
```

In this example:

- We define a text string and a regular expression pattern to search for the word "fox".
- We compile the regular expression pattern using `Pattern.compile()`.
- We create a `Matcher` object by invoking `matcher()` on the compiled pattern, passing the text string to search.
- We use the `find()` method on the `Matcher` object to search for the pattern within the text.
- If the pattern is found, we print the index of the first occurrence using the `start()` method of the `Matcher` object.

This is a basic example of using regular expressions in Java. Regular expressions can be much more complex and powerful, allowing you to define intricate patterns for various matching and manipulation tasks.

## String Methods Which Uses Regex
In Java's `String` class, there are several methods that utilize regular expressions for string manipulation and pattern matching. Some of the commonly used methods include:

1. **matches(String regex)**:
   - This method checks if the entire string matches the specified regular expression.
   - Returns `true` if the string matches the regex, `false` otherwise.

    ```java
    String str = "Hello, World!";
    boolean matches = str.matches("Hello.*");
    ```

2. **replaceAll(String regex, String replacement)**:
   - This method replaces all occurrences of the specified regular expression with the given replacement string.
   - Returns a new string with replacements applied.

    ```java
    String str = "apple, banana, orange";
    String replaced = str.replaceAll("[aeiou]", "");
    ```

3. **replaceFirst(String regex, String replacement)**:
   - This method replaces the first occurrence of the specified regular expression with the given replacement string.
   - Returns a new string with the first replacement applied.

    ```java
    String str = "apple, banana, orange";
    String replaced = str.replaceFirst("[aeiou]", "");
    ```

4. **split(String regex)**:
   - This method splits the string around matches of the specified regular expression.
   - Returns an array of strings split by the regex.

    ```java
    String str = "apple,banana,orange";
    String[] parts = str.split(",");
    ```

5. **split(String regex, int limit)**:
   - This method splits the string around matches of the specified regular expression, up to the specified limit.
   - Returns an array of strings split by the regex with a maximum length of `limit`.

    ```java
    String str = "apple,banana,orange";
    String[] parts = str.split(",", 2);
    ```

These are some of the `String` methods in Java that utilize regular expressions for various string manipulation tasks. Regular expressions provide powerful and flexible ways to search, replace, and manipulate strings based on patterns.

## Parts Of Regular Expression
A regular expression (regex) is composed of various elements, known as metacharacters, quantifiers, and literal characters, each serving a specific purpose in defining patterns for pattern matching and string manipulation. Here are the key parts of a regular expression:

[Read Oracle Java Docs On Patterns](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)

1. **Literal Characters**:
   - Literal characters represent themselves and match exactly with the same character in the input string. For example, the regex `abc` matches the sequence "abc" in the input string.

2. **Metacharacters**:
   - Metacharacters are special characters with a predefined meaning in regular expressions. They are used to define the structure and behavior of the pattern. Some common metacharacters include:
     - `.` (dot): Matches any single character except newline.
     - `^`: Matches the beginning of the input string.
     - `$`: Matches the end of the input string.
     - `\`: Escapes the next character, treating it as a literal character instead of a metacharacter. like `\d \w \s`
     - `[ ]`: Defines a character class, matching any single character within the brackets.
     - `|`: Specifies an alternation, matching either the expression before or after the pipe.
     - `( )`: Groups parts of the regex together.

3. **Character Classes**:
   - Character classes are used to define a set of characters that can match a single character at a specific position in the input string. For example:
     - `[abc]`: Matches any single character that is either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.
     - `[^abc]`: opposite of above
     - `[a-z]`: Matches any single lowercase alphabetic character.
     - `[0-9]`: Matches any single digit.

4. **Quantifiers**:
   - Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of the preceding element that are allowed in the input string. Some common quantifiers include:
     - `*`: Matches `zero` or more occurrences of the preceding element.
     - `+`: Matches `one` or more occurrences of the preceding element.
     - `?`: Matches `zero` or one occurrence of the preceding element.
     - `{m}`: Matches exactly `m` occurrences of the preceding element.
     - `{m,}`: Matches `m` and more occurrences of the preceding element.
     - `{m, n}`: Matches between `m` and `n` occurrences of the preceding element.

5. **Anchors**:
   - Anchors are used to specify the position within the input string where a match must occur. Some common anchors include:
     - `^`: Matches the beginning of the input string.
     - `$`: Matches the end of the input string.
     - `\b`: Matches a word boundary.

6. **Modifiers**:
   - Modifiers are used to change the behavior of the regex pattern matching. Some common modifiers include:
     - `i`: Case-insensitive matching.
     - `g`: Global matching (matches all occurrences).
     - `m`: Multiline matching (treats the input as multiple lines).

Regular expressions provide a powerful and flexible way to define patterns for searching, matching, and manipulating strings. Understanding the different parts of a regular expression allows you to construct complex patterns to suit your specific needs.

Some examples of regular expressions in Java along with their outputs:

1. **Literal Characters**:

```java
String input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
boolean found = input.matches("fox");
System.out.println(found); // Output: false
```

Explanation: In this example, the regular expression `"fox"` is a literal string. The `matches()` method checks if the input string contains the exact sequence "fox". Since the input string contains more than just "fox", the output is `false`.

2. **Metacharacters**:

```java
String input = "apple, banana, orange";
String[] parts = input.split("\\s*,\\s*");
for (String part : parts) {
    System.out.println(part);
}
```

Output:
```
apple
banana
orange
```

Explanation: In this example, the regular expression `"\\s*,\\s*"` uses the metacharacter `*` to match zero or more whitespace characters (`\\s`) followed by a comma and zero or more whitespace characters again. This pattern splits the input string based on commas followed by optional whitespace characters.

3. **Character Classes**:

```java
String input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
boolean found = input.matches(".*[aeiou].*");
System.out.println(found); // Output: true
```

Explanation: In this example, the regular expression `".*[aeiou].*"` matches any sequence of characters (`.*`) containing at least one vowel character (`[aeiou]`). Since the input string contains vowels ("e", "u", "i", "o", "e", "o", "e", "a", "o"), the output is `true`.

4. **Quantifiers**:

```java
String input = "aabbbccc";
boolean found = input.matches("a+b+c+");
System.out.println(found); // Output: true
```

Explanation: In this example, the regular expression `"a+b+c+"` matches one or more occurrences of "a", "b", and "c" consecutively. Since the input string contains one or more occurrences of "a", "b", and "c", the output is `true`.

5. **Anchors**:

```java
String input = "Hello, World!";
boolean found = input.matches("^Hello.*$");
System.out.println(found); // Output: true
```

Explanation: In this example, the regular expression `"^Hello.*$"` matches strings that start with "Hello" (`^` anchor) and end with any characters (`.*`) until the end of the string (`$`). Since the input string starts with "Hello", the output is `true`.

6. **Modifiers**:

```java
String input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
boolean found = input.matches("(?i)fox");
System.out.println(found); // Output: true
```

Explanation: In this example, the regular expression `"(?i)fox"` matches the sequence "fox" case-insensitively due to the `(?i)` modifier. Since the input string contains "fox", the output is `true`.

These examples demonstrate different aspects of regular expressions in Java and how they can be used for pattern matching and string manipulation tasks.

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String sentence = "Hello, World!";
        boolean matches = sentence.matches("Hello, World!");
        System.out.println(matches);

        String challenge2 = "[A-Z][a-z\\s]+[.]"; or // [A-Z].*\\.

        for (String s : List.of("The bike is red.",
                "I am a new student.",
                "hello world.",
                "How are you?")) {
            boolean matched = s.matches(challenge2);
            System.out.println(matched + ": " + s);
        }

        String challenge3 = "^[A-Z][\\p{all}]+[.?!]$";

        for (String s : List.of("The bike is red, and has flat tires.",
                "I love being a new L.P.A. student!",
                "Hello, friends and family: Welcome!",
                "How are you, Mary?")) {
            boolean matched = s.matches(challenge3);
            System.out.println(matched + ": " + s);
        }
    }
}

```

## Pattern And Matcher Of ReGex In JAVA
In Java, the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package are used to work with regular expressions. Here's how you can use them:

1. **Pattern**:
   - The `Pattern` class is used to compile a regular expression pattern into a `Pattern` object, which can then be used to create `Matcher` objects for pattern matching.
   - You can create a `Pattern` object by calling the `compile()` method, passing the regular expression pattern as a string.
   - The `Pattern` class provides various methods for working with regular expressions, such as `matcher()`, `split()`, and `matches()`.

2. **Matcher**:
   - The `Matcher` class is used to perform match operations on text using the compiled regular expression pattern.
   - You obtain a `Matcher` object by calling the `matcher()` method on a `Pattern` object, passing the text to be matched.
   - The `Matcher` class provides methods like `find()`, `group()`, `start()`, and `end()` to perform various operations on the matched text.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of `Pattern` and `Matcher`:

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define a regular expression pattern
        String regex = "quick";

        // Compile the regular expression pattern into a Pattern object
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);

        // Define the input text
        String text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

        // Create a Matcher object by applying the pattern to the input text
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);

        // Perform matching operations
        while (matcher.find()) {
            // Print the matched text
            System.out.println("Found match: " + matcher.group());
            // Print the start and end indices of the matched text
            System.out.println("Start index: " + matcher.start());
            System.out.println("End index: " + matcher.end());
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Found match: quick
Start index: 4
End index: 9
```

In this example:

- We define a regular expression pattern `"quick"`.
- We compile the pattern into a `Pattern` object using `Pattern.compile()`.
- We define the input text `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"`.
- We create a `Matcher` object by applying the pattern to the input text using `pattern.matcher()`.
- We use the `find()` method of the `Matcher` object to perform the matching operation.
- Inside the loop, we print the matched text using `matcher.group()` and the start and end indices of the matched text using `matcher.start()` and `matcher.end()` respectively.

## Pattern Methods In JAVA
The `Pattern` class in Java provides various methods for working with regular expressions. Here's an overview of some commonly used methods:

1. **`compile(String regex)`**:
   - Compiles the given regular expression pattern into a `Pattern` object.
   - This is a static method.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("abc+");
     ```

2. **`matcher(CharSequence input)`**:
   - Creates a `Matcher` object that matches the given input sequence against this pattern.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("abcc");
     ```

3. **`matches()`**:
   - Returns true if the entire input sequence matches the pattern.
   - Example:
     ```java
     boolean matches = pattern.matches("abcc");
     ```

4. **`split(CharSequence input)`**:
   - Splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String[] parts = pattern.split("abcc");
     ```

5. **`split(CharSequence input, int limit)`**:
   - Splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern, with the specified limit.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String[] parts = pattern.split("abcc", 2);
     ```

6. **`pattern()`**:
   - Returns the regular expression pattern string.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String regex = pattern.pattern();
     ```

7. **`flags()`**:
   - Returns the flags used by the matcher that would be returned by `matcher()`.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int flags = pattern.flags();
     ```

8. **`toString()`**:
   - Returns the string representation of this pattern.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String patternString = pattern.toString();
     ```

These are some of the commonly used methods provided by the `Pattern` class in Java for working with regular expressions. Depending on your requirements, you may use other methods provided by the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes for more advanced regular expression operations.

## Matcher Methods In JAVA
The `Matcher` class in Java provides various methods for performing operations on text using a compiled regular expression pattern. Here's an overview of some commonly used methods:

1. **`matches()`**:
   - Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.
   - Returns `true` if the entire region matches the pattern.
   - Example:
     ```java
     boolean matches = matcher.matches();
     ```

2. **`find()`**:
   - Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.
   - Returns `true` if a subsequence of the input sequence matches the pattern.
   - Example:
     ```java
     boolean found = matcher.find();
     ```

3. **`group()`**:
   - Returns the input subsequence captured by the previous match.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String matchedText = matcher.group();
     ```

4. **`group(int group)`**:
   - Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during the previous match operation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     String matchedText = matcher.group(1);
     ```

5. **`start()`**:
   - Returns the start index of the previous match.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int startIndex = matcher.start();
     ```

6. **`end()`**:
   - Returns the offset after the last character matched.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int endIndex = matcher.end();
     ```

7. **`start(int group)`**:
   - Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given group during the previous match operation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int startIndex = matcher.start(1);
     ```

8. **`end(int group)`**:
   - Returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence captured by the given group during the previous match operation.
   - Example:
     ```java
     int endIndex = matcher.end(1);
     ```

9. **`reset()`**:
   - Resets the matcher, allowing it to be reused for further matching operations.
   - Example:
     ```java
     matcher.reset();
     ```

10. **`usePattern(Pattern newPattern)`**:
    - Changes the pattern used by this matcher.
    - Example:
      ```java
      Pattern newPattern = Pattern.compile("newpattern");
      matcher.usePattern(newPattern);
      ```

These are some of the commonly used methods provided by the `Matcher` class in Java for performing operations on text using regular expressions. Depending on your requirements, you may use other methods provided by the `Matcher` class for more advanced regular expression operations.

## Grouping And Matching In Regex In JAVA
Grouping and capturing are essential features in regular expressions that allow you to match and extract parts of a string. In Java, grouping and capturing are achieved using parentheses `()` in the regular expression pattern. Here's an explanation with examples:

### Grouping:
Grouping in regular expressions allows you to treat multiple characters as a single unit. You can apply quantifiers and other metacharacters to the entire group. To create a group, you enclose the characters within parentheses `()`.

Example 1: Matching repeated characters using grouping:
```java
String input = "abbbbbbbc";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(b+)");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
while (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println("Match: " + matcher.group(1)); // Group 1 contains the matched substring
}
```
Output:
```
Match: bbbbbb
```

### Capturing:
Capturing in regular expressions allows you to extract specific parts of a matched substring. When you use parentheses `()` to create a group, the matched substring within the parentheses is captured and can be accessed later using the `group()` method of the `Matcher` object.

Example 2: Capturing specific parts of a string:
```java
String input = "John Doe, Jane Smith, Alex Johnson";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(\\w+ \\w+)");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
while (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println("Full Name: " + matcher.group(1)); // Group 1 contains the full name
}
```
Output:
```
Full Name: John Doe
Full Name: Jane Smith
Full Name: Alex Johnson
```

Example 3: Capturing parts of a date (day, month, year):
```java
String input = "Date: 2022-03-15";
Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("Date: (\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})");
Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
if (matcher.find()) {
    System.out.println("Year: " + matcher.group(1));
    System.out.println("Month: " + matcher.group(2));
    System.out.println("Day: " + matcher.group(3));
}
```
Output:
```
Year: 2022
Month: 03
Day: 15
```

In these examples:

- We use parentheses `()` to create groups within the regular expression pattern.
- Each group captures a specific part of the matched substring.
- We use the `group()` method of the `Matcher` object to access the captured groups. The index `1` refers to the first capturing group, `2` to the second capturing group, and so on.

Grouping and capturing are powerful features in regular expressions that allow you to extract and manipulate specific parts of strings based on patterns.

## Gmail Validation Code
Validating a Gmail address with a regular expression can be done, but keep in mind that Gmail's rules for email addresses can change over time. As of my last update in January 2022, here's a simple regular expression pattern that can be used to validate Gmail addresses:

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String email = "example@gmail.com";
        String regex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)*@gmail\\.com$";
        // ([\\w.-]+)@(.+)

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(email);

        if (matcher.matches()) {
            System.out.println("Valid Gmail address");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid Gmail address");
        }
    }
}


ORRRRRRRRR


import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        String emailText = """
                john.boy@valid.com
                john.boy@invalid
                jane.doe-smith@valid.co.uk
                jane_Doe1976@valid.co.uk
                bob-1964@valid.net
                bob!@invalid.com
                elaine@valid-test.com.au
                elaineinvalid1983@.com
                david@valid.io
                david@invalid..com
                """;

        Pattern partialPattern = Pattern.compile(
                "([\\w.-]+)@(([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,})");

        Matcher emailMatcher = partialPattern.matcher(emailText);
        emailMatcher.results().forEach(mr -> {
                    System.out.printf("[username=%s, domain=%s]%n",
                            mr.group(1),
                            mr.group(2));
                }
        );

        Pattern emailPattern = Pattern.compile(
                "([\\w.-]+)@(([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,})");
        String[] emailSamples = emailText.lines().toArray(String[]::new);
        for (String email : emailSamples) {
            Matcher eMatcher = emailPattern.matcher(email);
            boolean matched = eMatcher.matches();
            System.out.print(email + " is " + (matched ? "VALID " : "INVALID "));
            if (matched) {
                System.out.printf("[username=%s, domain=%s]%n",
                        eMatcher.group(1),
                        eMatcher.group(2));
            } else {
                System.out.println();
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Explanation of the regular expression pattern:

- `^`: Matches the start of the string.
- `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters or underscores.
- `(\\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of a dot followed by one or more alphanumeric characters or underscores (to allow for periods in the local part of the email address).
- `@gmail\\.com`: Matches the literal string "@gmail.com".
- `$`: Matches the end of the string.

This regular expression pattern checks for Gmail addresses that adhere to the following rules:
- The local part of the email address (before the "@") consists of one or more alphanumeric characters or underscores, followed by zero or more occurrences of a dot and alphanumeric characters or underscores.
- The domain part of the email address is "@gmail.com".

Please note that this regular expression pattern may not cover all possible valid Gmail addresses or account formats, as Gmail's rules for email addresses can change over time. Additionally, this pattern may not account for all edge cases or internationalized email addresses. It's recommended to consider the specific requirements and constraints of your application when implementing email address validation.
