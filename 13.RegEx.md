## What Is Regular Expression
A regular expression, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. In Java, regular expressions are represented by the `java.util.regex` package, which provides classes for pattern matching with regular expressions.

Regular expressions in Java can be used for various purposes, such as:

1. **String Search and Manipulation**: Regular expressions can be used to search, find, and manipulate strings based on patterns.

2. **Text Processing**: Regular expressions are handy for text processing tasks like validation, parsing, and extraction of specific information from text data.

3. **Pattern Matching**: Regular expressions are widely used for pattern matching tasks, such as matching email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, etc.

In Java, you typically use the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package to work with regular expressions. Here's a basic example demonstrating the usage of regular expressions in Java:

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
        String pattern = "fox";

        // Compile the regular expression pattern
        Pattern regex = Pattern.compile(pattern);

        // Create a Matcher object
        Matcher matcher = regex.matcher(text);

        // Find the first occurrence of the pattern in the text
        if (matcher.find()) {
            System.out.println("Pattern found at index: " + matcher.start());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Pattern not found");
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Pattern found at index: 16
```

In this example:

- We define a text string and a regular expression pattern to search for the word "fox".
- We compile the regular expression pattern using `Pattern.compile()`.
- We create a `Matcher` object by invoking `matcher()` on the compiled pattern, passing the text string to search.
- We use the `find()` method on the `Matcher` object to search for the pattern within the text.
- If the pattern is found, we print the index of the first occurrence using the `start()` method of the `Matcher` object.

This is a basic example of using regular expressions in Java. Regular expressions can be much more complex and powerful, allowing you to define intricate patterns for various matching and manipulation tasks.
