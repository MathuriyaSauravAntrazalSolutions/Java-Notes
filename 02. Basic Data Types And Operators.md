### Keywords In Java
Keywords in Java are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, class names, method names, etc.) in Java programs. These keywords are part of the language syntax and serve specific purposes in defining the structure and behavior of Java programs. Here's an overview of the keywords in Java:

1. **abstract**: Used to declare abstract classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.

33. **package**: Used to declare a package, which is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

34. **private**: Access modifier used to restrict access to members within the same class.

35. **protected**: Access modifier used to allow access to members within the same package or subclasses.

36. **public**: Access modifier used to allow unrestricted access to members.

37. **return**: Used to return a value from a method.

40. **strictfp**: Used to restrict floating-point calculations to ensure portability.

41. **super**: Used to refer to the superclass of the current object.

42. **switch**: Used to start a switch statement.

43. **synchronized**: Used to control access to methods or blocks of code by multiple threads.

These keywords form the foundation of Java syntax and are essential for writing Java programs. Understanding their meanings and proper usage is crucial for effective Java programming.

## Variables In Java
In Java, variables are containers that hold data which can be manipulated and referenced in a program. They are fundamental building blocks for storing and managing information within a program. Each variable has a specific data type, which determines the type of data it can hold (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.), and a unique name that identifies it within the scope of the program.

There are three main types of variables in Java:

1. **Local Variables**: These are declared within a method, constructor, or block and can only be accessed within the scope in which they are declared. Local variables must be initialized before they are used.

   ```java
   public void exampleMethod() {
       int localVar = 10; // Declaration and initialization of a local variable
       // localVar is accessible only within this method
       // Other code...
   }
   ```

2. **Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)**: These are declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block. They are initialized when an object of the class is created and exist for the lifetime of the object.

   ```java
   public class ExampleClass {
       int instanceVar; // Declaration of an instance variable

       public ExampleClass() {
           instanceVar = 20; // Initialization of the instance variable
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Class Variables (Static Fields)**: These are also declared within a class but are marked with the `static` keyword. They belong to the class rather than any specific instance of the class. They are initialized only once when the class is loaded and are shared among all instances of the class.

   ```java
   public class ExampleClass {
       static int classVar = 30; // Declaration and initialization of a class variable
   }
   ```

Variables in Java must be declared before they are used. The declaration typically includes the variable's data type followed by its name. It's important to note that Java is a statically-typed language, meaning that you must explicitly specify the data type of a variable at the time of declaration. Additionally, variables can be modified (assigned new values) throughout the program's execution, allowing for dynamic behavior and data manipulation.

## What is Expression In Java??
In Java, an expression is a combination of variables, operators, method invocations, and literals that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions can be simple or complex, depending on the elements they contain and the operations performed on those elements.

Basically en expression is a code segement which is on right side of equals sign in an assignment or declaration statement.

Here are some examples of expressions in Java:

1. Arithmetic Expressions:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   int sum = a + b; // Addition expression
   int product = a * b; // Multiplication expression
   ```

2. Boolean Expressions:
   ```java
   boolean isGreaterThan = a > b; // Greater than expression
   boolean isEqual = a == b; // Equality expression
   ```

3. Method Call Expressions:
   ```java
   String greeting = "Hello";
   int length = greeting.length(); // Method invocation expression
   ```

4. Conditional Expressions:
   ```java
   int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // Ternary conditional expression
   ```

5. Assignment Expressions:
   ```java
   int c = a + b; // Assignment expression
   ```

6. Instance Creation Expressions (New Expressions):
   ```java
   MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Instance creation expression
   ```

Expressions are used extensively in Java to perform computations, make decisions, and manipulate data. They can appear in various contexts such as variable initialization, method parameters, conditional statements, loop conditions, and more. Additionally, expressions can be nested within other expressions to create more complex behavior.

## Java is Case Sensetive
In Java, being case-sensitive means that identifiers such as variable names, method names, class names, and keywords must be written with consistent capitalization throughout the code. This means that Java considers "Variable", "variable", and "vArIaBlE" to be distinct identifiers.

Here's an overview of how case sensitivity works in Java with examples:

1. **Identifiers**: Variable names, method names, class names, and labels are all case-sensitive.

   ```java
   int myVariable = 10;
   int MyVariable = 20;
   // These two variables are different because of case sensitivity
   ```

2. **Keywords**: Java has a set of reserved words (keywords) that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords are case-sensitive.

   ```java
   int class = 5; // "class" is a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name
   ```

3. **Class names**: Class names must be written exactly as they are declared. This includes both the class name itself and its usage when creating objects.

   ```java
   class MyClass { ... }
   MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
   // "MyClass" must be written with the same capitalization throughout
   ```

4. **Method names**: Similarly, method names must maintain consistent capitalization.

   ```java
   public void myMethod() { ... }
   public void mymethod() { ... }
   // These are considered different methods due to the difference in case
   ```

5. **Package names**: Package names in Java are also case-sensitive.

   ```java
   package com.example.mypackage;
   import com.example.MyPackage; // This import statement is incorrect due to case sensitivity
   ```

6. **File names**: Java source files must have a name that matches the class name contained within, including case sensitivity.

   ```java
   // MyClass.java
   public class MyClass { ... }
   ```

7. **String literals**: String literals, unlike identifiers, are case-sensitive.

   ```java
   String myString = "Hello";
   System.out.println(myString); // Output: Hello
   System.out.println(mystring); // This would result in a compilation error
   ```

Understanding and adhering to Java's case sensitivity rules is crucial for writing error-free and maintainable code. Mixing cases in identifiers or keywords can lead to compilation errors or unexpected behavior.


## Primitive Data Types In Java
In Java, primitive data types are the most basic data types provided by the language. They are used to represent simple values and are not objects. Java has eight primitive data types, which are divided into four categories: integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values. Here's an overview of each primitive data type:

1. **Integers**:
   - `byte`: 8-bit signed integer. Range: -128 to 127.
   - `short`: 16-bit signed integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
   - `int`: 32-bit signed integer. Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
   - `long`: 64-bit signed integer. Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1.

   ```java
   byte myByte = 127;
   short myShort = 32767;
   int myInt = 2147483647;
   long myLong = 9223372036854775807L; // Note the 'L' suffix to denote it as a long literal
   int minValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // -2147483648
   int maxValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // 2147483648
   ```

2. **Floating-Point Numbers**:
   - `float`: 32-bit floating-point number. Range: approximately ±3.40282347E+38F.
   - `double`: 64-bit floating-point number. Range: approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308.

   ```java
   float myFloat = 3.14f; // Note the 'f' suffix to denote it as a float literal
   double myDouble = 3.14159;
   ```

3. **Characters**:
   - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character. Range: '\u0000' to '\uffff'.

   ```java
   char myChar = 'A';
   ```

4. **Boolean**:
   - `boolean`: Represents true or false values.

   ```java
   boolean myBoolean = true;
   ```

These primitive data types are directly supported by the Java programming language and are more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance compared to their object counterparts (e.g., `Integer`, `Double`, `Character`, etc.). They are used extensively in Java programs for representing and manipulating data efficiently.


## Classes In JAVA

In Java, classes are fundamental building blocks used for defining objects and their behavior in object-oriented programming (OOP). They serve as blueprints or templates for creating objects, which are instances of a class. Here's an overview of classes in Java:

1. **Definition**: A class in Java is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name. It typically contains fields (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior and properties of objects created from the class.

   ```java
   public class MyClass {
       // Fields (variables)
       private int myField;

       // Constructor
       public MyClass(int value) {
           myField = value;
       }

       // Methods
       public void myMethod() {
           // Method body
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Objects**: Objects are instances of classes. They are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor. Each object has its own set of fields and can invoke methods defined in its class.

   ```java
   MyClass obj1 = new MyClass(10);
   MyClass obj2 = new MyClass(20);
   ```

3. **Fields (Variables)**: Fields are variables declared within a class. They represent the state of objects created from the class and define their properties. Fields can have different access modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`, `protected`) to control their visibility and accessibility.

4. **Constructors**: Constructors are special methods used for initializing objects when they are created. They have the same name as the class and may have parameters to initialize object properties.

5. **Methods (Functions)**: Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior of objects created from the class. They can perform various operations and can access and modify the object's state through its fields.

6. **Inheritance**: Java supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit fields and methods from other classes. This promotes code reuse and allows for hierarchical classification of classes.

7. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). Access to the data is controlled through methods, promoting data security and integrity.

8. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object. Classes and methods can be abstract, allowing for the creation of generic and reusable components.

9. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables methods to behave differently based on the actual object being operated upon, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.

Classes are essential for organizing and structuring Java programs in an object-oriented manner, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.

## Wrapper Classes In JAVA
In Java, wrapper classes are a set of classes that provide an object-oriented way to represent primitive data types as objects. These classes wrap the primitive data types and provide methods to manipulate and work with them in an object-oriented context. The primary purpose of wrapper classes is to provide a way to treat primitive types as objects, allowing them to be used in scenarios where objects are required, such as collections, generics, and methods that require objects as parameters.

Java provides wrapper classes for each of its primitive data types:

1. `Byte`: Wraps a byte primitive type.
2. `Short`: Wraps a short primitive type.
3. `Integer`: Wraps an int primitive type.
4. `Long`: Wraps a long primitive type suffix `l or L`.
5. `Float`: Wraps a float primitive type suffex - `f or F`.
6. `Double`: Wraps a double primitive type.
7. `Character`: Wraps a char primitive type.
8. `Boolean`: Wraps a boolean primitive type.


**NOTE -** Always use `L` and `f` for long and float variables.

For example, if you want to use an `int` value as an object, you can use the `Integer` wrapper class:

```java
System.out.println(Long.SIZE); // A long has a width of 64
int primitiveInt = 10;
Integer wrappedInt = Integer.valueOf(primitiveInt); // Wrapping int value as an Integer object
```

Similarly, you can extract the primitive value from a wrapper object:

```java
Integer wrappedInt = Integer.valueOf(20);
int primitiveInt = wrappedInt.intValue(); // Extracting the int value from the Integer object
```

Wrapper classes also provide useful methods for converting between primitive types, parsing strings into primitive values, and performing arithmetic operations. Additionally, they are used extensively in Java's collections framework, as collections can only store objects, not primitive types.

Wrapper classes are also commonly used in scenarios where nullable values are required, as they can represent null values using the `null` keyword. However, wrapper classes incur a small overhead compared to primitive types due to the additional memory required to store the object overhead.

## Overflow And Underflow In JAVA
In Java, overflow and underflow refer to situations where the value of a variable exceeds its maximum or minimum limit, respectively, based on the data type of the variable. This can happen when performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, especially with primitive data types. Let's explore overflow and underflow with examples:

1. **Overflow**:

   Overflow occurs when a value exceeds the maximum limit that can be represented by its data type. For example, if you try to add two large integers that result in a value greater than the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`, overflow occurs.

   ```java
   int maxInt = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Maximum value of int
   int overflow = maxInt + 1; // Overflow occurs here
   System.out.println(overflow); // Output: -2147483648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE)
   ```

   In this example, `maxInt` represents the maximum value that can be stored in an `int`. When you add 1 to it, the result exceeds the maximum limit, causing overflow. As a result, the value wraps around to the minimum value of `int` (Integer.MIN_VALUE).

2. **Underflow**:

   Underflow occurs when a value goes below the minimum limit that can be represented by its data type. For example, if you subtract a large value from a smaller one that results in a value less than the minimum value that can be represented by an `int`, underflow occurs.

   ```java
   int minInt = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // Minimum value of int
   int underflow = minInt - 1; // Underflow occurs here
   System.out.println(underflow); // Output: 2147483647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE)
   ```

   In this example, `minInt` represents the minimum value that can be stored in an `int`. When you subtract 1 from it, the result goes below the minimum limit, causing underflow. As a result, the value wraps around to the maximum value of `int` (Integer.MAX_VALUE).

Overflow and underflow can lead to unexpected behavior and errors in Java programs, so it's essential to handle them appropriately. In some cases, you may need to use larger data types or implement error-checking mechanisms to prevent or detect overflow and underflow situations.

**Note -** overflow and underflow works only for the expressions only.
**Note -** you will get an error if you directly assign a big integer to a variable 

**Note -** in java we can not use in between an integer but can use `_` as it will act as readable syntax.
```java
int num = 1,23,4; // wrong way
int num = 1_24_30_766; // acceptable
```
