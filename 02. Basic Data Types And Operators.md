## First Program
* open cmd and initialize JShell using Command `jshell`.
* use this `statement` `System.out.print("Hello World!");` Bingo You have written your First Program In Java.
* here `"hello world!"` is a string literal and always use `""` for string literals and `''` for character literal.

### What is statement??
statement is a complete command to be executed can include one or more `expression` will talk about expression in next chapter.


### Keywords In Java
Keywords in Java are reserved words that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, class names, method names, etc.) in Java programs. These keywords are part of the language syntax and serve specific purposes in defining the structure and behavior of Java programs. Here's an overview of the keywords in Java:

1. **abstract**: Used to declare abstract classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses.

2. **assert**: Used to perform assertions in the code. It's typically used for debugging purposes to check the correctness of certain conditions.

3. **boolean**: Represents a boolean type with values true and false.

4. **break**: Used to terminate the execution of a loop or switch statement.

5. **byte**: Represents an 8-bit signed integer type.

6. **case**: Used within switch statements to define different cases.

7. **catch**: Used to catch exceptions that are thrown during program execution.

8. **char**: Represents a 16-bit Unicode character.

9. **class**: Used to declare a class.

10. **const** (not used): Reserved for future use. It was intended to declare constants, but it's not implemented in Java.

11. **continue**: Used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue to the next iteration.

12. **default**: Used within switch statements to define the default case.

13. **do**: Used to start a do-while loop.

14. **double**: Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point type.

16. **enum**: Used to define enumerated types. Introduced in Java 5.

17. **extends**: Used to indicate inheritance in class declarations.

18. **final**: Used to declare constants, make classes not extendable, and make methods not overrideable.

19. **finally**: Used in exception handling to define a block of code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught.

20. **float**: Represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point type.

21. **for**: Used to start a for loop.

22. **goto** (not used): Reserved for future use. It's not implemented in Java and cannot be used.

23. **if**: Used to start an if statement.

24. **implements**: Used to indicate that a class implements an interface.

25. **import**: Used to import classes or entire packages into the current source file.

26. **instanceof**: Used to test if an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.

27. **int**: Represents a 32-bit signed integer type.

28. **interface**: Used to declare an interface.

30. **native**: Used to specify that a method is implemented in native code, typically written in another programming language like C or C++.

31. **new**: Used to create new objects.

32. **null**: Represents a null reference, which indicates that a reference variable does not refer to any object.

33. **package**: Used to declare a package, which is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.

34. **private**: Access modifier used to restrict access to members within the same class.

35. **protected**: Access modifier used to allow access to members within the same package or subclasses.

36. **public**: Access modifier used to allow unrestricted access to members.

37. **return**: Used to return a value from a method.

38. **short**: Represents a 16-bit signed integer type.

39. **static**: Used to declare members (fields and methods) that belong to the class rather than to instances of the class.

40. **strictfp**: Used to restrict floating-point calculations to ensure portability.

41. **super**: Used to refer to the superclass of the current object.

42. **switch**: Used to start a switch statement.

43. **synchronized**: Used to control access to methods or blocks of code by multiple threads.

44. **this**: Used to refer to the current object within its own instance method.

45. **throw**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.

46. **throws**: Used in method declarations to indicate the exceptions that the method may throw.

47. **transient**: Used to indicate that a field should not be serialized when the object is serialized.

These keywords form the foundation of Java syntax and are essential for writing Java programs. Understanding their meanings and proper usage is crucial for effective Java programming.

## Variables In Java
In Java, variables are containers that hold data which can be manipulated and referenced in a program. They are fundamental building blocks for storing and managing information within a program. Each variable has a specific data type, which determines the type of data it can hold (e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.), and a unique name that identifies it within the scope of the program.

There are three main types of variables in Java:

1. **Local Variables**: These are declared within a method, constructor, or block and can only be accessed within the scope in which they are declared. Local variables must be initialized before they are used.

   ```java
   public void exampleMethod() {
       int localVar = 10; // Declaration and initialization of a local variable
       // localVar is accessible only within this method
       // Other code...
   }
   ```

2. **Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)**: These are declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block. They are initialized when an object of the class is created and exist for the lifetime of the object.

   ```java
   public class ExampleClass {
       int instanceVar; // Declaration of an instance variable

       public ExampleClass() {
           instanceVar = 20; // Initialization of the instance variable
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Class Variables (Static Fields)**: These are also declared within a class but are marked with the `static` keyword. They belong to the class rather than any specific instance of the class. They are initialized only once when the class is loaded and are shared among all instances of the class.

   ```java
   public class ExampleClass {
       static int classVar = 30; // Declaration and initialization of a class variable
   }
   ```

Variables in Java must be declared before they are used. The declaration typically includes the variable's data type followed by its name. It's important to note that Java is a statically-typed language, meaning that you must explicitly specify the data type of a variable at the time of declaration. Additionally, variables can be modified (assigned new values) throughout the program's execution, allowing for dynamic behavior and data manipulation.

## What is Expression In Java??
In Java, an expression is a combination of variables, operators, method invocations, and literals that can be evaluated to produce a value. Expressions can be simple or complex, depending on the elements they contain and the operations performed on those elements.

Basically en expression is a code segement which is on right side of equals sign in an assignment or declaration statement.

Here are some examples of expressions in Java:

1. Arithmetic Expressions:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   int sum = a + b; // Addition expression
   int product = a * b; // Multiplication expression
   ```

2. Boolean Expressions:
   ```java
   boolean isGreaterThan = a > b; // Greater than expression
   boolean isEqual = a == b; // Equality expression
   ```

3. Method Call Expressions:
   ```java
   String greeting = "Hello";
   int length = greeting.length(); // Method invocation expression
   ```

4. Conditional Expressions:
   ```java
   int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // Ternary conditional expression
   ```

5. Assignment Expressions:
   ```java
   int c = a + b; // Assignment expression
   ```

6. Instance Creation Expressions (New Expressions):
   ```java
   MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // Instance creation expression
   ```

Expressions are used extensively in Java to perform computations, make decisions, and manipulate data. They can appear in various contexts such as variable initialization, method parameters, conditional statements, loop conditions, and more. Additionally, expressions can be nested within other expressions to create more complex behavior.

## Java is Case Sensetive
In Java, being case-sensitive means that identifiers such as variable names, method names, class names, and keywords must be written with consistent capitalization throughout the code. This means that Java considers "Variable", "variable", and "vArIaBlE" to be distinct identifiers.

Here's an overview of how case sensitivity works in Java with examples:

1. **Identifiers**: Variable names, method names, class names, and labels are all case-sensitive.

   ```java
   int myVariable = 10;
   int MyVariable = 20;
   // These two variables are different because of case sensitivity
   ```

2. **Keywords**: Java has a set of reserved words (keywords) that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers. These keywords are case-sensitive.

   ```java
   int class = 5; // "class" is a keyword and cannot be used as a variable name
   ```

3. **Class names**: Class names must be written exactly as they are declared. This includes both the class name itself and its usage when creating objects.

   ```java
   class MyClass { ... }
   MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
   // "MyClass" must be written with the same capitalization throughout
   ```

4. **Method names**: Similarly, method names must maintain consistent capitalization.

   ```java
   public void myMethod() { ... }
   public void mymethod() { ... }
   // These are considered different methods due to the difference in case
   ```

5. **Package names**: Package names in Java are also case-sensitive.

   ```java
   package com.example.mypackage;
   import com.example.MyPackage; // This import statement is incorrect due to case sensitivity
   ```

6. **File names**: Java source files must have a name that matches the class name contained within, including case sensitivity.

   ```java
   // MyClass.java
   public class MyClass { ... }
   ```

7. **String literals**: String literals, unlike identifiers, are case-sensitive.

   ```java
   String myString = "Hello";
   System.out.println(myString); // Output: Hello
   System.out.println(mystring); // This would result in a compilation error
   ```

Understanding and adhering to Java's case sensitivity rules is crucial for writing error-free and maintainable code. Mixing cases in identifiers or keywords can lead to compilation errors or unexpected behavior.


## Primitive Data Types In Java
In Java, primitive data types are the most basic data types provided by the language. They are used to represent simple values and are not objects. Java has eight primitive data types, which are divided into four categories: integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and boolean values. Here's an overview of each primitive data type:

1. **Integers**:
   - `byte`: 8-bit signed integer. Range: -128 to 127.
   - `short`: 16-bit signed integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
   - `int`: 32-bit signed integer. Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
   - `long`: 64-bit signed integer. Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1.

   ```java
   byte myByte = 127;
   short myShort = 32767;
   int myInt = 2147483647;
   long myLong = 9223372036854775807L; // Note the 'L' suffix to denote it as a long literal
   int minValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE; // 2147483648
   ```

2. **Floating-Point Numbers**:
   - `float`: 32-bit floating-point number. Range: approximately ±3.40282347E+38F.
   - `double`: 64-bit floating-point number. Range: approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308.

   ```java
   float myFloat = 3.14f; // Note the 'f' suffix to denote it as a float literal
   double myDouble = 3.14159;
   ```

3. **Characters**:
   - `char`: 16-bit Unicode character. Range: '\u0000' to '\uffff'.

   ```java
   char myChar = 'A';
   ```

4. **Boolean**:
   - `boolean`: Represents true or false values.

   ```java
   boolean myBoolean = true;
   ```

These primitive data types are directly supported by the Java programming language and are more efficient in terms of memory usage and performance compared to their object counterparts (e.g., `Integer`, `Double`, `Character`, etc.). They are used extensively in Java programs for representing and manipulating data efficiently.
