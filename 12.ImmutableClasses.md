## Hiding vs Overriding
In Java, the concepts of hiding and overriding are relevant to instance methods, not static or private methods. However, let's discuss how private and static methods behave in inheritance:

1. **Private Methods**:
   - Private methods in a superclass cannot be overridden in a subclass because they are not accessible from outside the class in which they are declared.
   - If a subclass declares a method with the same signature as a private method in its superclass, it's not considered overriding; instead, it's a new method in the subclass.
   - Example:

     ```java
     class Superclass {
         private void privateMethod() {
             System.out.println("Superclass private method");
         }

         public void publicMethod() {
             privateMethod();
         }
     }

     class Subclass extends Superclass {
         // This is not overriding, but a new method in Subclass
         private void privateMethod() {
             System.out.println("Subclass private method");
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Subclass obj = new Subclass();
             Superclass obj2 = new Subclass();
             obj.publicMethod(); // Calls the Superclass private method
             obj2.publicMethod(); // calls the superclass private method
             // same goes for static method
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Static Methods**:
   - Similar to private methods, static methods cannot be overridden in Java.
   - Even if a subclass declares a static method with the same signature as a static method in its superclass, it's not considered overriding; instead, it's a new method in the subclass.
   - Example:

     ```java
     class Superclass {
         static void staticMethod() {
             System.out.println("Superclass static method");
         }
         
         // child classes will not be able to hide/define it now.
         // used to prevent subclasses to make their own versions
         static final void staticMethod2() {
             System.out.println("Superclass static method");
         }
     }

     class Subclass extends Superclass {
         // This is not overriding, but a new method in Subclass
         static void staticMethod() {
             System.out.println("Subclass static method");
         }

         // this declaration will throw error
         static void staticMethod2() {
             System.out.println("Superclass static method");
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Subclass.staticMethod(); // Calls the Subclass static method
         }
     }
     ```

In summary, private and static methods in Java do not participate in inheritance in the same way as instance methods. Private methods are not accessible outside the class they are declared in, and static methods belong to their class, not to instances, so they cannot be overridden.

## Immutable Classes And Immutable Objects
Immutable classes and immutable objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like Java. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **Immutable Class**:
   - An immutable class is a class whose instances cannot be modified after they are created.
   - Once an immutable object is created, its state cannot be changed through its public interface.
   - Immutable classes typically have the following characteristics:
     - All fields are `private` and `final`, preventing direct modification.
     - No mutator methods (methods that modify the state) are provided.
     - If the class contains mutable objects, they are safely copied during construction or returned through accessor methods to ensure the immutability of the object.
   - Immutable classes are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot change after construction, making them useful in concurrent programming.

Example of an immutable class in Java:

```java
public final class ImmutablePerson {
    private final String name;
    private final int age;

    public ImmutablePerson(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}
```

2. **Immutable Object**:
   - An immutable object is an instance of an immutable class.
   - Once an immutable object is created, its state cannot be altered.
   - Immutable objects are often used in scenarios where changes to object state need to be controlled or when thread safety is a concern.
   - Because they cannot be changed after creation, immutable objects are inherently safe to share between multiple threads without synchronization.

Example usage of an immutable object:

```java
ImmutablePerson person = new ImmutablePerson("John", 30);
String name = person.getName(); // Accessor method to retrieve name
int age = person.getAge(); // Accessor method to retrieve age
```

In summary, immutable classes and objects provide several benefits, including simplicity, thread safety, and easier debugging, by ensuring that the state of objects remains constant throughout their lifetime. They are particularly useful in concurrent programming and functional programming paradigms.

## Deep Copy Vs Shallow Copy
In Java, "deep copy" and "shallow copy" refer to different mechanisms for copying objects, especially when dealing with objects that contain other objects. Here's an explanation of each:

1. **Shallow Copy**:
   - Shallow copy creates a new object and then copies the non-static fields of the current object to the new object.
   - If the field is a primitive type, it copies the value of the primitive field.
   - If the field is a reference to an object, it copies the reference to the original object. In other words, both the original object and the copied object will refer to the same object in memory.
   - Changes made to the objects referred to by the original object's fields will also be reflected in the copied object, and vice versa.

Example of shallow copy in Java:

```java
class Point {
    public int x, y;
}

public class ShallowCopyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Point original = new Point();
        original.x = 1;
        original.y = 2;

        Point copy = original; // Shallow copy

        // Modify original
        original.x = 3;

        // Both original and copy have the same values
        System.out.println("Original: (" + original.x + ", " + original.y + ")");
        System.out.println("Copy: (" + copy.x + ", " + copy.y + ")");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Original: (3, 2)
Copy: (3, 2)
```

2. **Deep Copy**:
   - Deep copy creates a new object and then recursively copies all fields of the original object to the new object.
   - If the field is a primitive type, it copies the value of the primitive field.
   - If the field is a reference to an object, it recursively creates a new copy of the referenced object and assigns it to the corresponding field in the new object.
   - Deep copy ensures that changes made to the objects referred to by the original object's fields do not affect the copied object, and vice versa.

Example of deep copy in Java (using serialization):

```java
import java.io.*;

class Point implements Serializable {
    public int x, y;
}

public class DeepCopyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        Point original = new Point();
        original.x = 1;
        original.y = 2;

        // Deep copy using serialization
        ByteArrayOutputStream bos = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(bos);
        oos.writeObject(original);
        oos.flush();
        oos.close();

        ByteArrayInputStream bis = new ByteArrayInputStream(bos.toByteArray());
        ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(bis);
        Point copy = (Point) ois.readObject();
        ois.close();

        // Modify original
        original.x = 3;

        // Original and copy have different values
        System.out.println("Original: (" + original.x + ", " + original.y + ")");
        System.out.println("Copy: (" + copy.x + ", " + copy.y + ")");
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Original: (3, 2)
Copy: (1, 2)
```

In summary, shallow copy creates a new object with copies of the original object's fields, while deep copy creates a new object with copies of all fields, including any objects referenced by the original object's fields.

## Copy Cunstructor 
In Java, a copy constructor is a special constructor that initializes a new object by copying the values from an existing object of the same class. It's typically used to create a new object with the same state as another object.

Here's how you can create a copy constructor in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private int intValue;
    private String stringValue;

    // Constructor
    public MyClass(int intValue, String stringValue) {
        this.intValue = intValue;
        this.stringValue = stringValue;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    public MyClass(MyClass other) {
        this.intValue = other.intValue;
        this.stringValue = other.stringValue;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public int getIntValue() {
        return intValue;
    }

    public void setIntValue(int intValue) {
        this.intValue = intValue;
    }

    public String getStringValue() {
        return stringValue;
    }

    public void setStringValue(String stringValue) {
        this.stringValue = stringValue;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass original = new MyClass(10, "Hello");

        // Creating a copy using copy constructor
        MyClass copy = new MyClass(original);

        // Modifying the original object
        original.setIntValue(20);
        original.setStringValue("World");

        // Printing values of both original and copy
        System.out.println("Original: " + original.getIntValue() + ", " + original.getStringValue());
        System.out.println("Copy: " + copy.getIntValue() + ", " + copy.getStringValue());
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Original: 20, World
Copy: 10, Hello
```

In the above example, `MyClass` has a copy constructor that takes an object of the same class (`MyClass`) as a parameter and initializes the new object with the same values as the provided object.

When the `main` method is executed, a new `MyClass` object `original` is created with initial values (10, "Hello"). Then, another `MyClass` object `copy` is created using the copy constructor, which initializes it with the same values as `original`. After modifying the `original` object's values, you can see that the `copy` object retains its original values, demonstrating the successful copy performed by the copy constructor.

## Immutable, Unmodifiable Collections and Views In JAVA
In Java, immutable collections, unmodifiable collections, and views provide different mechanisms for creating collections with restricted modification capabilities. Each approach has its own characteristics and use cases:

1. **Immutable Collections**:
   - Immutable collections are collections whose elements cannot be changed once the collection is created.
   - Once initialized, immutable collections cannot be modified in any way, including adding, removing, or modifying elements.
   - Java provides immutable implementations for certain collection types like `List`, `Set`, and `Map` through utility classes in the `java.util` package, such as `Collections.unmodifiableList`, `Collections.unmodifiableSet`, and `Collections.unmodifiableMap`.
   - Immutable collections are useful when you need to ensure that a collection's state remains constant throughout its lifetime, which can be beneficial for thread safety and preventing unintended modifications.

Example of creating an immutable list:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ImmutableCollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> mutableList = new ArrayList<>();
        mutableList.add("one");
        mutableList.add("two");
        
        List<String> immutableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(mutableList);
        
        // This will throw UnsupportedOperationException
        // immutableList.add("three");
    }
}
```

2. **Unmodifiable Collections**:
   - Unmodifiable collections are wrappers around existing collections that prevent modification operations but allow the underlying collection to be changed.
   - Unlike immutable collections, unmodifiable collections reflect changes made to the original collection they are wrapping.
   - Unmodifiable collections are created using the `Collections.unmodifiableXXX` methods, similar to immutable collections, but they differ in that they do not create a separate copy of the collection; instead, they provide a view of the original collection that disallows modification operations.
   - Unmodifiable collections are useful when you need to expose a read-only view of a mutable collection without allowing modification.

Example of creating an unmodifiable list view:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class UnmodifiableCollectionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> mutableList = new ArrayList<>();
        mutableList.add("one");
        mutableList.add("two");
        
        List<String> unmodifiableList = Collections.unmodifiableList(mutableList);
        
        // Modifications to the original list will be reflected in the unmodifiable list
        mutableList.add("three");
        
        System.out.println(unmodifiableList); // Output: [one, two, three]
        
        // This will throw UnsupportedOperationException
        // unmodifiableList.add("four");
    }
}
```

3. **Views**:
   - Views are similar to unmodifiable collections but are typically provided directly by the collection itself rather than through utility methods.
   - Views provide read-only access to certain portions or aspects of a collection.
   - Java collections such as `Map` and `List` often provide methods to obtain read-only views of specific parts of the collection, such as `keySet()`, `entrySet()`, and `subList()`.

Example of obtaining a read-only view from a `HashMap`:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CollectionViewExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("one", 1);
        map.put("two", 2);
        
        Set<String> keySetView = map.keySet(); // Get a read-only view of the keys
        
        // Modifications to the original map will be reflected in the keySetView
        map.put("three", 3);
        
        System.out.println(keySetView); // Output: [one, two, three]
        
        // This will throw UnsupportedOperationException
        // keySetView.add("four");
    }
}
```

In summary, immutable collections, unmodifiable collections, and views provide different levels of immutability and restrictions on modification operations, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate approach based on their specific requirements.     


**Note:** These are Some Methods Of Collections Which Returns Unmodifable Collections `copyOf(), of(), ofEntries(), keySet(), Map.entry(K k, V v)`

## Instance Initializer
In Java, instance initializers are blocks of code within a class that are executed when an instance of the class is created. They are particularly useful for initializing instance variables of a class.

Instance initializers are defined within a class using the following syntax:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Instance variables
    private int x;
    private int y;

    // Instance initializer block
    {
        // Initialization code
        x = 10;
        y = 20;
        System.out.println("Instance initializer block executed");
    }

    // Constructor
    public MyClass() {
        System.out.println("Constructor executed");
    }

    // Other methods
    // ...
}
```

In the above example:

- The instance initializer block is enclosed within curly braces `{}` and is placed within the class body.
- It does not have a method name and is executed each time an instance of the class is created, before the constructor.
- Instance initializers allow you to perform common initialization tasks for multiple constructors or to initialize instance variables based on complex logic.
- If a class has multiple instance initializer blocks, they are executed in the order they appear in the class, from top to bottom, and before the constructor.
- Instance initializer blocks are particularly useful when you have several constructors and want to avoid duplicating initialization code in each constructor.

Here's an example of using instance initializer blocks:

```java
public class Example {
    private int value;

    // Instance initializer block
    {
        if (System.currentTimeMillis() % 2 == 0) {
            value = 10;
        } else {
            value = 20;
        }
    }

    // Constructor
    public Example() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }

    // Other methods
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the instance initializer block initializes the `value` variable based on some condition (in this case, the current time). The value is then printed from the constructor. Each time an instance of `Example` is created, the initializer block is executed to determine the initial value of `value`. 

## Static Initializer
In Java, static initializers are blocks of code within a class that are executed when the class is loaded into memory by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). They are used to perform one-time initialization of static variables or to execute any static initialization code.

Static initializers are defined within a class using the following syntax:

```java
public class MyClass {
    // Static variable
    private static int x;

    // Static initializer block
    static {
        // Initialization code
        x = 10;
        System.out.println("Static initializer block executed");
    }

    // Other methods
    // ...
}
```

In the above example:

- The static initializer block is declared using the `static` keyword and enclosed within curly braces `{}`.
- It does not have a method name and is executed only once when the class is loaded into memory, before any instance of the class is created or any static member of the class is accessed.
- Static initializers allow you to initialize static variables or perform static initialization tasks that need to be done before any instance of the class is created.
- If a class has multiple static initializer blocks, they are executed in the order they appear in the class, from top to bottom.

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of static initializers:

```java
public class Example {
    private static int value;

    // Static initializer block
    static {
        // Initialization code
        value = 100;
        System.out.println("Static initializer block executed");
    }

    // Static method
    public static int getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Value: " + getValue());
    }
}
```

In this example, the static initializer block initializes the `value` variable to 100. When the `main` method is executed, it calls the `getValue` method, which returns the initialized value of `value`. The static initializer block is executed only once, before any instance of the `Example` class is created or any static member is accessed.

## Record Construtor In JAVA
In Java, starting from version 14, you can use records, which are a special kind of class primarily meant for storing data. Records provide concise syntax for declaring classes that are simple data carriers, often referred to as "data classes" or "value types." When you define a record, Java automatically generates several things for you, including the constructor, accessors (getter methods), `equals()` method, `hashCode()` method, and `toString()` method.

Here's how you can define a record in Java and how the constructor is implicitly created:

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    // No need to explicitly define constructor, accessors, equals, hashCode, or toString methods
    // can define a explicit constructor also like 
    public Person(String name, int age){
        // to do some validation stuff
        this.name = name;
        if(age >= 5) this.age = age;
        else this.age = 5;
    }

    // copy constructor
    public Person(Person p){
        this(p.name, p.age);
    }
}
```

In the above example:

- `Person` is a record class with two components: `name` and `age`.
- The record declaration automatically creates a constructor that takes the same parameters as the components (`name` and `age`), allowing you to create instances of the `Person` class without explicitly defining a constructor.
- The generated constructor initializes the components with the values provided during object creation.
- Additionally, the record automatically generates accessor methods (`getName()` and `getAge()`), an `equals()` method for comparing two `Person` objects for structural equality, a `hashCode()` method for generating a hash code based on the object's components, and a `toString()` method for producing a string representation of the object's state.

Here's an example of how you can use the record `Person`:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Person object using the generated constructor
        Person person = new Person("John", 30);
        
        // Accessor methods can be used to retrieve the values
        System.out.println("Name: " + person.name());
        System.out.println("Age: " + person.age());
        
        // Automatically generated toString() method
        System.out.println("Person: " + person);
    }
}
```

Output:
```
Name: John
Age: 30
Person: Person[name=John, age=30]
```

In summary, records in Java provide a concise way to define classes for storing data, and the constructor is implicitly created for you based on the components you define in the record declaration.

## Enum Constructor In JAVA
In Java, enumerations (enums) are special data types used to define collections of constants. Enumerations can have constructors, fields, and methods just like regular classes. However, enum constructors are implicitly private and can't be invoked directly from outside the enum class.

Here's an example of how you can define an enum with a constructor:

```java
public enum Day {
    // Enum constants
    MONDAY("Monday"),
    TUESDAY("Tuesday"),
    WEDNESDAY("Wednesday"),
    THURSDAY("Thursday"),
    FRIDAY("Friday"),
    SATURDAY("Saturday"),
    SUNDAY("Sunday");

    // Enum fields
    private final String dayName;

    // Enum constructor 
    // always should be private
    private Day(String dayName) {
        this.dayName = dayName;
    }

    // Enum method
    public String getDayName() {
        return dayName;
    }
}
```

In the above example:

- We define an enum called `Day` representing days of the week.
- Each enum constant (`MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, etc.) is followed by its corresponding day name enclosed in parentheses. This is how we pass parameters to the enum constructor.
- The enum constructor takes a `String` parameter `dayName` and assigns it to the `dayName` field for each enum constant.
- The enum constructor is implicitly `private` to prevent external instantiation.
- We define a method `getDayName()` to retrieve the day name associated with each enum constant.

Here's how you can use the enum:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Day day = Day.MONDAY;
        
        // Accessing enum fields and methods
        System.out.println(day + " is " + day.getDayName());
    }
}
```

Output:
```
MONDAY is Monday
```

In summary, enum constructors in Java are implicitly private and are used to initialize the fields of enum constants. Enum constructors cannot be invoked directly from outside the enum class.

## Sealed Classes In JAVA

Sealed classes, which are found in languages like Kotlin and Scala, allow you to restrict the inheritance hierarchy of a class to a predefined set of subclasses. This restriction provides more control over the extensibility and maintenance of class hierarchies.

While sealed classes are not yet a part of the Java language, they have been discussed in various Java Enhancement Proposals (JEPs) and OpenJDK mailing lists. The goal is to introduce a syntax that allows a class or interface to specify its permitted subclasses or implementors.

For example, a sealed class in Java might look something like this:

```java
public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square, Triangle {
    // Class definition
}

final Circle {}
sealed Square {}
non-sealed Triangle {} // no need to extend now
```

In this hypothetical syntax, the `Shape` class is declared as sealed, and it permits only the `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes to extend it. Any other attempt to subclass `Shape` would result in a compilation error.

Subclasses of Sealed class must be declared `final`, `sealed` or `non-sealed`.
final -> no subclass can extend it
sealed -> it has to permit
non-sealed -> any one can inharit this subclass

Sealed classes can help improve code maintainability, extensibility, and security by explicitly defining the set of allowable subclasses or implementors, thus reducing the risk of unintended or unsafe extensions.

While sealed classes are not yet available in Java, they remain an area of interest and ongoing discussion within the Java community and may be introduced in future versions of the language. As always, it's essential to stay updated with the latest Java releases and proposals to see if and when sealed classes become part of the language.
